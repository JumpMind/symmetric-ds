The Incoming Batches screens allows you to monitor batches that have been delivered to the target node.

endif::pro[]

Incoming batches are delivered to the target node when the source node <<_push_job,pushes>> or when the target node <<_pull_job,pulls>>.

Incoming batches are written to the <<Staging Area>> first and then loaded.  The use of the staging area can be turned off by setting the `stream.to.file.enabled` parameter.

==== Incoming Batch Errors

When a batch fails to load it is marked with an Error status.

===== Analyzing the Issue
          
Analysis using an incoming batch is different than that of outgoing batches.  

ifndef::pro[]

For incoming batches, you will rely on two tables,
<<INCOMING_BATCH>> and <<INCOMING_ERROR>>.

The first step in analyzing the cause of an incoming failed batch is to locate information about the batch, starting with
<<INCOMING_BATCH>>
.  To locate batches in error, use:

[source, sql]
----
select * from sym_incoming_batch where error_flag=1;
----

Several useful pieces of information are available from this query:

* The batch number of the failed batch, available in column `BATCH_ID`.  Note that this is the batch number of the
outgoing batch on the outgoing node.
* The node the batch is being sent from, available in column `NODE_ID`.
* The channel to which the batch belongs, available in column `CHANNEL_ID`.
All subsequent batches on this channel from this node will be held until the error condition is resolved.
* The data_id that was being processed when the batch failed, available in column `FAILED_DATA_ID`.
* Any SQL message, SQL State, and SQL Codes being returned during the synchronization attempt, available in columns `SQL_MESSAGE`,
`SQL_STATE`, and `SQL_CODE`, respectively.

For incoming batches, we do not have data and data event entries in the database we can query.
We do, however, have a table, <<INCOMING_ERROR>>, which provides some information about the batch.

[source, sql]
----
select * from sym_incoming_error
where batch_id='XXXXXX' and node_id='YYYYY';
----
where XXXXXX is the batch id and YYYYY is the node id of the failing batch.

This query returns a wealth of information about each data change in a batch, including:

* The table involved in each data change, available in column `TARGET_TABLE_NAME`,
* The event type (Update [U], Insert [I], or Delete [D]), available in column `EVENT_TYPE`,
* A comma separated list of the new data and (optionally) the old data, available in columns `ROW_DATA` and
`OLD_DATA`, respectively,
* The column names of the table, available in column `COLUMN_NAMES`,
* The primary key column names of the table, available in column `PK_COLUMN_NAMES`,

Batches in Error can be viewed when the *Status* is set to _<Not Ok>_ or _Error_.

The error message can be viewed by clicking the *Status* link.

===== Resolving the Issue
           
For batches in error, from the incoming side you'll also have to decide the best course of action to fix the issue.

Incoming batch errors _that are in conflict_ can by fixed by taking advantage of two columns in <<INCOMING_ERROR>> which are examined each time
batches are processed.  The first column, `resolve_data` if filled in will be used in place of `row_data`.
The second column, `resolve_ignore` if set will cause this particular data item to be ignored and batch processing to continue.  This is the same
two columns used when a manual conflict resolution strategy is chosen, as discussed in <<Conflicts>>.
