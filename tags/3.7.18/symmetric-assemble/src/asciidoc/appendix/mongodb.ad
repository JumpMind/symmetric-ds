Since SymmetricDS is trigger based and there are not triggers in MongoDB data can only synchronized to a MongoDB instance.  The runtime SymmetricDS 
tables will also need to be installed in a full relational database to support integration with MongoDB.

TIP:  The simplest solution to support MongoDB is to add a new node (see <<Add Node>>) that is connected to an H2 database to store all the SYM_* runtime tables.
           
The MongoDB data loader maps relational database rows to MongoDB documents in collections.  To use the preconfigured MongoDB data loader,
you set the `data_loader_type` to *MongoDB* on a <<Channels, channel>>.

Tables that should be synchronized to MongoDB should be configured to use this channel.

In order to point it to a MongoDB instance set the following properties in the engines properties file.

[source,properties]   
----       
mongodb.username=xxxx
mongodb.password=xxxx
mongodb.host=xxxx
mongodb.port=xxxx
mongodb.default.databasename=default
----
      
By default, the catalog or schema passed by SymmetricDS will be used for the MongoDB database name. The table passed by SymmetricDS 
will be used as the MongoDB collection name.  If the catalog or schema are not set, the default database name property is used as the 
database name. 
           
The _id of the MongoDB document will be the primary key of the database record. If the table has a composite primary key, then the 
_id will be an embedded document that has name value pairs of the composite key. The body of the document will be name value pairs 
of the table column name and table row value.
           
SymmetricDS uses the MongoDB Java Driver to upsert documents.
           
TIP: SymmetricDS transforms can be used to transform the data.  If a complex mapping is required that is not supported by transforms, then
the `IDBObjectMapper` can be implemented and a new `MongoDataLoaderFactory` can be wired up
as an extension point.
