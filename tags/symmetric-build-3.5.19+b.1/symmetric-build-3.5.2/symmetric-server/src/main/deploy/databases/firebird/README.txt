Symmetric UDF for Interbase
----------------------------
This folder contains a user defined function (UDF) library that must be installed in the Interbase 9.0
database for SymmetricDS to work properly.  It includes the sym_escape() and sym_hex() functions used
by the database triggers to escape strings and BLOBs.

How to Install
--------------
The sym_udf library is copied to the UDF folder under the Firebird installation directory.

For Linux users:

   Copy sym_udf.so to /opt/interbase/UDF

For Windows users:

   Copy sym_udf.dll to C:\CodeGear\InterBase\UDF

When SymmetricDS starts up for the first time, it will enable the functions (using the
"create external function" command) and test that they are working.

How to Build
------------
If you want to the build the library yourself, the following files are included:

Source files:
* sym_udf.c      - The C program implementing the user defined functions
* sym_udf.h      - The header file with function declarations

For Unix users:
* build.sh       - A shell program for Unix that compiles and links the sym_udf library

For Windows users:
* sym_udf.vcproj - A project file for Microsoft Visual Studio
* sym_udf.sln    - A solution file for Microsoft Visual Studio
* sym_udf.def    - A DLL definition file for Microsoft Visual Studio
