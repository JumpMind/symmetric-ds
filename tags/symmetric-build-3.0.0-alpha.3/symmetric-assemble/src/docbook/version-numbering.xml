        version guidelines. In summary, the version is denoted as three integers in the
        format of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Major versions are incompatible at the API level, and
        they can include any kind of change. Minor versions are compatible with older
        versions at the API and binary level, and they can introduce new functions or remove
        old ones. Patch versions are perfectly compatible, and they are released to fix
        defects.
