<para>
<xref linkend="planning" xrefstyle="select: label" />
introduced numerous concepts and the analysis and design needed to
create an implementation of SymmetricDS. This chapter re-visits each
analysis step and documents how to turn a SymmetricDS design into
reality through configuration of the various SymmetricDS tables. In
addition, several advanced configuration options, not presented
previously, will also be covered.
</para>

<section id="configuration-node-properties">
<title>Node Properties</title>

<para>
To get a SymmetricDS node running, it needs to be given an identity and
it needs to know how to connect to the database it will be
synchronizing. The preferred way to configure a SymmetricDS engine is to
create a properties file in the engines directory. The SymmetricDS
server will create an engine for each properties file found in the
engines directory. When started up, SymmetricDS reads the
synchronization configuration and state from the database. If the
configuration tables are missing, they are created automatically (auto
creation can be disabled). Basic configuration is described by inserting
into the following tables (the complete data model is defined in
<xref linkend="data-model" />
).

</para>

<para>During start up, triggers are verified against the
database, and database triggers are installed on tables that require
data changes to be captured. The Route, Pull and Push Jobs begin running
to synchronize changes with other nodes.</para>

<para>
Each node requires properties that allow it to connect to a database and
register with a parent node. Properties are configured in a file named
<code>xxxxx.properties</code>
that is placed in the engines directory of the SymmetricDS install. The
file is usually named according to the engine.name, but it is not a
requirement.
</para>

<para>
To give a node its identity, the following properties are required. Any
other properties found in
<code>conf/symmetric.properties</code>
can be overridden for a specific engine in an engine's properties file.
If the properties are changed in
<code>conf/symmetric.properties</code>
they will take effect across all engines deployed to the server. Note
that you can use the variable
<literal>$(hostName)</literal>
to represent the host name of the machine when defining these properties
(for example, external.id=$(hostName) ).

</para>

<para>The {webcontext} is blank for a standalone deployment. It

<section id="configuration-node">
<title>Node</title>

<para>
A
<emphasis>node</emphasis>
, a single instance of SymmetricDS, is defined in the
<xref linkend="table_node" xrefstyle="table" />
table. Two other tables play a direct role in defining a node, as well
The first is
<xref linkend="table_node_identity" xrefstyle="table" />
. The
<emphasis>only</emphasis>
row in this table is inserted in the database when the node first
<emphasis>registers</emphasis>
with a parent node. In the case of a root node, the row is entered by
the user. The row is used by a node instance to determine its node
identity.
</para>

<para>
The following SQL statements set up a top-level registration server as a
node identified as "00000" in the "corp" node group.
<programlisting> insert into SYM_NODE (node_id,
node_group_id, external_id, sync_enabled) values ('00000', 'corp',
'00000', 1); insert into SYM_NODE_IDENTITY values ('00000');</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
The second table,
<xref linkend="table_node_security" xrefstyle="table" />
has rows created for each
<emphasis>child</emphasis>
node that registers with the node, assuming auto-registration is
enabled. If auto registration is not enabled, you must create a row in
<xref linkend="table_node" xrefstyle="table" />
and
<xref linkend="table_node_security" xrefstyle="table" />
for the node to be able to register. You can also, with this table,
manually cause a node to re-register or do a re-initial load by setting
the corresponding columns in the table itself. Registration is discussed
in more detail in
<xref linkend="configuration-registration" />
.
</para>
</section>

<section id="configuration-node-group">
<title>Node Group</title>

<para>
Node Groups are straightforward to configure and are defined in the
<xref linkend="table_node_group" xrefstyle="table" />
table. The following SQL statements would create node groups for "corp"
and "store" based on our retail store example.
<programlisting> insert into SYM_NODE_GROUP
(node_group_id, description) values ('store', 'A retail store node');

insert into SYM_NODE_GROUP (node_group_id, description) values ('corp',
'A corporate node');</programlisting>
</para>
</section>

<section id="configuration-node-group-link">
<title>Node Group Link</title>

<para>
Similarly, Node Group links are established using a data event action of
'P' for Push and 'W' for Pull ("wait"). The following SQL statements
links the "corp" and "store" node groups for synchronization. It
configures the "store" nodes to push their data changes to the "corp"
nodes, and the "corp" nodes to send changes to "store" nodes by waiting
for a pull.
<programlisting> insert into SYM_NODE_GROUP_LINK
(source_node_group, target_node_group, data_event_action) values
('store', 'corp', 'P'); insert into SYM_NODE_GROUP_LINK
(source_node_group, target_node_group, data_event_action) values
('corp', 'store', 'W');</programlisting>
</para>

<para>A node group link can be configured to use the same node
group as the source and the target. This configuration allows a node
group to sync with every other node in its group.</para>
<para>A third type of link action of 'R' for 'Route Only' exists
if you want to associate a router with a link that will not move the
data. This action type might be useful when using an XML publishing
router or an audit table changes router.</para>
</section>

<section id="configuration-channel">
<title>Channel</title>

<para>
By categorizing data into channels and assigning them to
<xref linkend="table_trigger" xrefstyle="table" />
s, the user gains more control and visibility into the flow of data. In
addition, SymmetricDS allows for synchronization to be enabled,
suspended, or scheduled by channels as well. The frequency of
synchronization and order that data gets synchronized is also controlled
at the channel level.
</para>

<para>
The following SQL statements setup channels for a retail store. An
"item" channel includes data for items and their prices, while a
"sale_transaction" channel includes data for ringing sales at a
register.
<programlisting> insert into SYM_CHANNEL (channel_id,
processing_order, max_batch_size, max_batch_to_send,
extract_period_millis, batch_algorithm, enabled, description) values
('item', 10, 1000, 10, 0, 'default', 1, 'Item and pricing data'); insert
into SYM_CHANNEL (channel_id, processing_order, max_batch_size,
max_batch_to_send, extract_period_millis, batch_algorithm, enabled,
description) values ('sale_transaction', 1, 1000, 10, 60000,
'transactional', 1, 'retail sale transactions from register');</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Batching is the grouping of data, by channel, to be transferred and
committed at the client together. There are three different
out-of-the-box batching algorithms which may be configured in the
batch_algorithm column on channel.
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
<command>default</command>
</term>

<listitem>
<para>All changes that happen in a transaction are guaranteed to
be batched together. Multiple transactions will be batched and committed
together until there is no more data to be sent or the max_batch_size is
reached.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<command>transactional</command>
</term>

<listitem>
<para>Batches will map directly to database transactions. If
there are many small database transactions, then there will be many
batches. The max_batch_size column has no effect.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<command>nontransactional</command>
</term>

<listitem>
<para>Multiple transactions will be batched and committed
together until there is no more data to be sent or the max_batch_size is
reached. The batch will be cut off at the max_batch_size regardless of
whether it is in the middle of a transaction.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</para>

<para>
If a channel contains
<emphasis>only</emphasis>
tables that will be synchronized in one direction and and data is routed
to all the nodes in the target node groups, then batching on the channel
can be optimized to share batches across nodes. This is an important
feature when data needs to be routed to thousands of nodes. When this
mode is detected, you will see batches created in
<xref linkend="table_outgoing_batch" xrefstyle="table" />
with the
<literal>common_flag</literal>
set to 1.
</para>

<para>
There are also several size-related parameters that can be set by
channel. They include:
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
<command>max_batch_size</command>
</term>

<listitem>
<para>Specifies the maximum number of data events to process
within a batch for this channel.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<command>max_batch_to_send</command>
</term>

<listitem>
<para>Specifies the maximum number of batches to send for a given
channel during a 'synchronization' between two nodes. A
'synchronization' is equivalent to a push or a pull. For example, if
there are 12 batches ready to be sent for a channel and
max_batch_to_send is equal to 10, then only the first 10 batches will be
sent even though 12 batches are ready.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<command>max_data_to_route</command>
</term>

<listitem>
<para>Specifies the maximum number of data rows to route for a
channel at a time.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</para>

<para>Based on your particular synchronization requirements, you
can also specify whether old, new, and primary key data should be read
and included during routing for a given channel. These are controlled by
the columns use_old_data_to_route, use_row_data_to_route, and
use_pk_data_to_route, respectively. By default, they are all 1 (true).</para>

<para>
Finally, if data on a particular channel contains big lobs, you can set
the column contains_big_lob to 1 (true) to provide SymmetricDS the hint
that the channel contains big lobs. Some databases have shortcuts that
SymmetricDS can take advantage of if it knows that the lob columns in
<xref linkend="table_data" xrefstyle="table" />
aren't going to contain large lobs. The definition of how large a 'big'
lob is varies from database to database.
</para>
</section>

<section id="configuration-triggers-and-routers">
<title>Triggers, Routers, and Trigger / Routers Mappings</title>

<para>In order to synchronize data, you must define at least one
trigger, at least one router, and provide at least one link between the
two (known as a trigger-router). </para>

<section id="configuration-trigger">
<title>Trigger</title>

<para>
SymmetricDS captures synchronization data using database triggers.
SymmetricDS' Triggers are defined in the
<xref linkend="table_trigger" xrefstyle="table" />
table. Each record is used by SymmetricDS when generating database
triggers. Database triggers are only generated when a trigger is
associated with a
<xref linkend="table_router" xrefstyle="table" />
whose
<literal>source_node_group_id</literal>
matches the node group id of the current node.
</para>

<para>
The
<literal>source_table_name</literal>
may contain the asterisk ('*') wildcard character so that one
<xref linkend="table_trigger" xrefstyle="table" />
table entry can define synchronization for many tables. System tables
and any tables that start with the SymmetricDS table prefix will be
excluded. A list of wildcard tokens can also be supplied. If there are
multiple tokens, they should be delimited with a comma. A wildcard token
can also start with a bang ('!') to indicate an exclusive match. Tokens
are always evalulated from left to right. When a table match is made,
the table is either added to or removed from the list of tables. If
another trigger already exists for a table, then that table is not
included in the wildcard match (the explictly defined trigger entry take
precendence).
</para>

<para>
When determining whether a data change has occurred or not, by defalt
the triggers will record a change even if the data was updated to the
same value(s) they were originally. For example, a data change will be
captured if an update of one column in a row updated the value to the
same value it already was. There is a global property,
<literal>trigger.update.capture.changed.data.only.enabled</literal>
(false by default), that allows you to override this behavior. When set
to true, SymmetricDS will only capture a change if the data has truly
changed (i.e., when the new column data is not equal to the old column
data).
</para>

<important>
The property
<literal>trigger.update.capture.changed.data.only.enabled</literal>
is currently only supported in the MySQL, DB2 and Oracle dialects.
</important>

<para>
The following SQL statement defines a trigger that will capture data for
a table named "item" whenever data is inserted, updated, or deleted. The
trigger is assigned to a channel also called 'item'.
<programlisting> insert into SYM_TRIGGER
(trigger_id,source_table_name,channel_id,last_update_time,create_time)
values ('item', 'item', 'item', current_timestamp, current_timestamp); </programlisting>
</para>

<important>
<para>Note that many databases allow for multiple triggers of the
same type to be defined. Each database defines the order in which the
triggers fire differently. If you have additional triggers beyond those
SymmetricDS installs on your table, please consult your database
documentation to determine if there will be issues with the ordering of
the triggers.</para>
</important>


<section id="configuration-trigger-lobs">

</para>
</section>

<section id="configuration-trigger-external-select">
<title>External Select</title>

<para>
Occasionally, you may find that you need to capture and save away a
piece of data present in another table when a trigger is firing. This
data is typically needed for the purposes of determining where to
'route' the data to once routing takes place. Each trigger definition
contains an optional
<literal>external_select</literal>
field which can be used to specify the data to be captured. Once
captured, this data is available during routing in
<xref linkend="table_data" xrefstyle="table" />
's
<literal>external_data</literal>
field. For these cases, place a SQL select statement which returns the
data item you need for routing in
<literal>external_select</literal>
. An example of the use of external select can be found in
<xref linkend="configuration-routing-external-select" />
.
</para>
</section>
</section>

<section id="configuration-router">
<title>Router</title>

<para>
Routers provided in the base implementation currently include:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Default Router - a router that sends all data to
all nodes that belong to the target node group defined in the router.</listitem>

<listitem>Column Match Router - a router that compares old or
new column values to a constant value or the value of a node's
external_id or node_id.</listitem>

<listitem>Lookup Router - a router which can be configured to
determine routing based on an existing or ancillary table specifically
for the purpose of routing data.</listitem>

<listitem>Subselect Router - a router that executes a SQL
expression against the database to select nodes to route to. This SQL
expression can be passed values of old and new column values.</listitem>

<listitem>Scripted Router - a router that executes a Bean
Shell script expression in order to select nodes to route to. The script

More than one column may be configured in a router_expression. When more
than one column is configured, all matches are added to the list of
nodes to route to. The following is an example where the STORE_ID column
may contain the STORE_ID to route to or the constant of ALL which
indicates that all nodes should receive the update.

EXTERNAL_ID, or to all nodes if the STORE_ID is null.

<section id="configuration-subselect-router">
<title>Subselect Router</title>

<para>
Sometimes routing decisions need to be made based on data that is not in
the current row being synchronized. A 'subselect' router can be used in
these cases. A 'subselect' is configured with a
<literal>router_expression</literal>
that is a SQL select statement which returns a result set of the node
ids that need routed to. Column tokens can be used in the SQL expression
and will be replaced with row column data. The overhead of using this
router type is high because the 'subselect' statement runs for each row
that is routed. It should not be used for tables that have a lot of rows
that are updated. It also has the disadvantage that if the data being
relied on to determine the node id has been deleted before routing takes
place, then no results would be returned and routing would not happen.
</para>
<para>
The
<literal>router_expression</literal>
you specify is appended to the following SQL statement in order to
select the node ids:
<programlisting>select c.node_id from sym_node c where
c.node_group_id=:NODE_GROUP_ID and c.sync_enabled=1 and ... </programlisting>
<para>
As you can see, you have access to information about the node currently
under consideration for routing through the 'c' alias, for example
<literal>c.external_id</literal>
. There are two node-related tokens you can use in your expression:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>:NODE_GROUP_ID</listitem>
<listitem>:EXTERNAL_DATA</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
Column names representing data for the row in question are prefixed with
a colon as well, for example:

<literal>:EMPLOYEE_ID</literal>
, or
<literal>:OLD_EMPLOYEE_ID</literal>
. Here, the OLD_ prefix indicates the value before the change in cases
where the old data has been captured.

</para>
<para> For an example, consider the case where an Order table and
an OrderLineItem table need to be routed to a specific store. The Order
table has a column named order_id and STORE_ID. A store node has an
external_id that is equal to the STORE_ID on the Order table.
OrderLineItem, however, only has a foreign key to its Order of order_id.
To route OrderLineItems to the same nodes that the Order will be routed
to, we need to reference the master Order record.</para>

<para>
There are two possible ways to solve this in SymmetricDS. One is to
configure a 'subselect' router_type on the
<xref linkend="table_router" xrefstyle="table" />
table, shown below (The other possible approach is to use an
<literal>external_select</literal>
to capture the data via a trigger for use in a column match router,
demonstrated in
<xref linkend="configuration-routing-external-select" />
).
</para>

<para>
Our solution utilizing subselect compares the external id of the current
node with the store id from the Order table where the order id matches
the order id of the current row being routed:
<programlisting> insert into SYM_ROUTER (router_id,
source_node_group_id, target_node_group_id, router_type,
router_expression, create_time, last_update_time) values
('corp-2-store','corp', 'store', 'subselect', 'c.external_id in (select
STORE_ID from order where order_id=:ORDER_ID)', current_timestamp,
current_timestamp); </programlisting>
</para>

<para>As a final note, please note in this example that the
parent row in Order must still exist at the moment of routing for the
child rows (OrderLineItem) to route, since the select statement is run
when routing is occurring, not when the change data is first captured. </para>

<section id="configuration-scripted-router">
<title>Scripted Router</title>

<para>
When more flexibility is needed in the logic to choose the nodes to
route to, then the a scripted router may be used. The currently
available scripting language is Bean Shell. Bean Shell is a Java-like
scripting language. Documentation for the Bean Shell scripting language
can be found at
<ulink url="http://www.beanshell.org/">http://www.beanshell.org</ulink>
.
</para>

<para>
The router_type for a Bean Shell scripted router is 'bsh'. The
router_expression is a valid Bean Shell script that:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
adds node ids to the
<code>targetNodes</code>
collection which is bound to the script
</listitem>

<listitem>returns a new collection of node ids</listitem>

<listitem>returns a single node id</listitem>

<listitem>returns true to indicate that all nodes should be
routed or returns false to indicate that no nodes should be routed</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
Also bound to the script evaluation is a list of
<code>nodes</code>
. The list of
<code>nodes</code>
is a list of eligible
<code>org.jumpmind.symmetric.model.Node</code>
objects. The current data column values and the old data column values
are bound to the script evaluation as Java object representations of the
column data. The columns are bound using the uppercase names of the
columns. Old values are bound to uppercase representations that are
prefixed with 'OLD_'.
</para>

<para>
If you need access to any of the SymmetricDS services, then the instance
of
<code>org.jumpmind.symmetric.ISymmetricEngine</code>
is accessible via the bound
<code>engine</code>
variable.
</para>

<para>
In the following example, the node_id is a combination of STORE_ID and
WORKSTATION_NUMBER, both of which are columns on the table that is being
routed.
<programlisting> insert into SYM_ROUTER (router_id,
source_node_group_id, target_node_group_id, router_type,
router_expression, create_time, last_update_time) values
('corp-2-store-bsh','corp', 'store', 'bsh', 'targetNodes.add(STORE_ID +
"-" + WORKSTATION_NUMBER);', current_timestamp, current_timestamp); </programlisting>
</para>

<para>
The same could also be accomplished by simply returning the node id. The
last line of a bsh script is always the return value.
<programlisting> insert into SYM_ROUTER (router_id,
source_node_group_id, target_node_group_id, router_type,
router_expression, create_time, last_update_time) values

The following example will synchronize to all nodes if the FLAG column
has changed, otherwise no nodes will be synchronized. Note that here we
make use of OLD_, which provides access to the old column value.

<title>Audit Table Router</title>

<para>
This router audits captured data by recording the change in an audit
table that the router creates and keeps up to date (as long as
<code>auto.config.database</code>
is set to true.) The router creates a table named the same as the table
for which data was captured with the suffix of _AUDIT. It will contain
all of the same columns as the original table with the same data types
only each column is nullable with no default values.
</para>

<para>
Three extra "AUDIT" columns are added to the table:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>AUDIT_ID - the primary key of the table.</listitem>
<listitem>AUDIT_TIME - the time at which the change occurred.</listitem>
<listitem>AUDIT_EVENT - the DML type that happened to the

</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
The following is an example of an audit router
<programlisting> insert into SYM_ROUTER (router_id,

last_update_time) values ('audit_at_corp','corp', 'local', 'audit',

</para>

<para>The audit router captures data for a group link. For the
audit router to work it must be associated with a node_group_link with
an action of type 'R'. The 'R' stands for 'only routes to'. In the above
example, we refer to a 'corp to local' group link. Here, local is a new
node_group created for the audit router. No nodes belong to the 'local'
node_group. If a trigger linked to an audit router fires on the corp
node, a new audit table will be created at the corp node with the new
data inserted.</para>

<section id="configuration-routing-external-select">
<title>Utilizing External Select when Routing</title>



<para>
There may be times when you wish to route based on a piece of data that
exists in a table other than the one being routed. The approach, first
discussed in
<xref linkend="configuration-subselect-router" />
, is to utilize an
<literal>external_select</literal>
to save away data in
<literal>external_data</literal>
, which can then be referenced during routing.
</para>
<para>
Reconsider subselect's Order / OrderLineItem example (found in
<xref linkend="configuration-subselect-router" />
), where routing for the line item is accomplished by linking to the
"header" Order row. As an alternate way of solving the problem, we will
now use External Select combined with a column match router.
</para>
<para>
In this version of the solution, the STORE_ID is captured from the Order
table in the EXTERNAL_DATA column when the trigger fires. The router is
configured to route based on the captured EXTERNAL_DATA to all nodes
whose external id matches the captured external data.
<programlisting>insert into SYM_TRIGGER
(trigger_id,source_table_name,channel_id,external_select,
last_update_time,create_time) values ('orderlineitem', 'orderlineitem',
'orderlineitem','select STORE_ID from order where
order_id=$(curTriggerValue).$(curColumnPrefix)order_id',
current_timestamp, current_timestamp); insert into SYM_ROUTER
(router_id, source_node_group_id, target_node_group_id, router_type,
router_expression, create_time, last_update_time) values
('corp-2-store-ext','corp', 'store', 'column',
'EXTERNAL_DATA=:EXTERNAL_ID', current_timestamp, current_timestamp); </programlisting>
</para>

<para>The following variables can be used with the external select:</para>

<variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
		<term>
    		<command>$(curTriggerValue)</command>
		</term>	
		<listitem>
    		<para>
    		  Variable to be replaced with the NEW or OLD column alias provided by the trigger context, which is platform specific.
    		  For insert and update triggers, the NEW alias is used; for delete triggers, the OLD alias is used.
    		  For example, "$(curTriggerValue).COLUMN" becomes ":new.COLUMN" for an insert trigger on Oracle.
    		</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
        <term>
            <command>$(curColumnPrefix)</command>
        </term> 
        <listitem>
            <para>
                Variable to be replaced with the NEW_ or OLD_ column prefix for platforms that don't support column aliases.
                This is currently only used by the H2 database.  All other platforms will replace the variable with an empty string.
                For example "$(curColumnPrefix)COLUMN" becomes "NEW_COLUMN" on H2 and "COLUMN" on Oracle.
            </para>
        </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>The advantage of this approach over the 'subselect'
approach is that it guards against the (somewhat unlikely) possibility
that the master Order table row might have been deleted before routing
has taken place. This external select solution also is a bit more
efficient than the 'subselect' approach, although the triggers produced
do run the extra external_select SQL inline with application database
updates.</para>

The

<section id="configuration-initial-load">

<title>Initial Loads</title>

<para>An initial load is the process of seeding tables at a
target node with data from its parent node. When a node connects and
data is extracted, after it is registered and if an initial load was
requested, each table that is configured to synchronize to the target
node group will be given a reload event in the order defined by the end
user. A SQL statement is run against each table to get the data load
that will be streamed to the target node. The selected data is filtered
through the configured router for the table being loaded. If the data
set is going to be large, then SQL criteria can optionally be provided
to pare down the data that is selected out of the database.</para>

<para>
An initial load cannot occur until after a node is registered. An
initial load is requested by setting the
<literal>initial_load_enabled</literal>
column on
<xref linkend="table_node_security" xrefstyle="table" />
to
<emphasis>1</emphasis>
on the row for the target node in the parent node's database. You can
configure SymmetricDS to automatically perform an initial load when a
node registers by setting the parameter
<literal>auto.reload</literal>
to true. Regardless of how the initial load is initiated, the next time
the source node routes data, reload batches will be inserted. At the
same time reload batches are inserted, all previously pending batches
for the node are marked as successfully sent.
</para>

<important>
<para>
Note that if the parent node that a node is registering with is
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
a registration server node (as can happen with a registration redirect
or certain non-tree structure node configurations) the parent node's
<xref linkend="table_node_security" xrefstyle="table" />
entry must exist at the parent node and have a non-null value for column
<literal>initial_load_time</literal>
. Nodes can't be registered to non-registration-server nodes without
this value being set one way or another (i.e., manually, or as a result
of an initial load occurring at the parent node).
</para>
</important>

<para>
SymmetricDS recognizes that an initial load has completed when the
<literal>initial_load_time</literal>
column on the target node is set to a non-null value.
</para>

<para>
An initial load is accomplished by inserting reload batches in a defined
order according to the
<literal>initial_load_order</literal>
column on
<xref linkend="table_trigger_router" xrefstyle="table" />
. If the
<literal>initial_load_order</literal>
column contains a negative value the associated table will
<emphasis>NOT</emphasis>
be loaded. If the
<literal>initial_load_order</literal>
column contains the same value for multiple tables, SymmetricDS will
attempt to order the tables according to foreign key constraints. If
there are cyclical constraints, then foreign keys might need to be
turned off or the initial load will need to be manually configured based
on knowledge of how the data is structured.

An efficient way to select a subset of data from a table for an initial

. This clause, if present, is applied as a

execute assuming that the more optimal path is using the

One example of the use of an initial load select would be if you wished
to only load data created more recently than the start of year 2011.
Say, for example, the column

<section id="configuration-initial-load-batches">
<title>Splitting an Initial Load for a Table Across Multiple Batches</title>
<para>
By default, all data for a given table will be initial loaded in a single batch, regardless
of the max batch size parameter on the reload channel.  That is, for a table with one million
rows, all rows for that table will be initial loaded and sent to the destination node in a
single batch. For large tables, this can result in a batch that can take a long time to
extract and load.
</para>

<para>
Initial loads for a table can be broken into multiple batches by specifying
<literal>initial.load.use.extract.job.enabled</literal> to true.  This parameter allows
SymmetricDS to pre-extract initial load batches versus having them extracted when
the batch is pulled or pushed.  When using this parameter, there are two ways to tell
SymmetricDS the number of batches to create for a given table.  The first is to specify
a positive integer in the initial_load_batch_count column on
<xref linkend="table_trigger_router" xrefstyle="table" />.  This
number will dictate the number of batches created for the initial load of the given table.
The second way is to specify 0 for initial_load_batch_count on
<xref linkend="table_trigger_router" xrefstyle="table" /> and
specify a max_batch_size on the reload channel in <xref linkend="table_channel" xrefstyle="table" />.
When 0 is specified for
initial_load_batch_count, SymmetricDS will execute a count(*) query on the table during
the extract process and create N batches based on the total number of records found
in the table divided by the max_batch_size on the reload channel.

<section id="configuration-initial-load-reverse">
<title>Reverse Initial Loads</title>
<para>
The default behavior for initial loads is to load data from the
registration server or parent node, to a client node. Occasionally,
there may be need to do a one-time intial load of data in the opposite
or "reverse" direction, namely from a client node to the registration
node. To achieve this, set the parameter
<literal>auto.reload.reverse</literal>
to be true,
<emphasis>but only for the specific node group representing
the client nodes</emphasis>
. This will cause a onetime reverse load of data, for tables configured
with non-negative initial load orders, to be batched at the point when
registration of the client node is occurring. These batches are then
sent to the parent or registration node. This capability might be
needed, for example, if there is data already present in the client that
doesn't exist in the parent but needs to.

<section id="configuration-dead-triggers">
<title>Dead Triggers</title>

<para>
Occasionally the decision of what data to load initially results in
additional triggers. These triggers, known as
<emphasis>Dead Triggers</emphasis>
, are configured such that they do not capture any data changes. A
"dead" Trigger is one that does not capture data changes. In other
words, the
<literal>sync_on_insert</literal>
,
<literal>sync_on_update</literal>

<emphasis>will</emphasis>
be included in the initial load of data for target Nodes.
</para>

<para>Why might you need a Dead Trigger? A dead Trigger might be
used to load a read-only lookup table, for example. It could also be
used to load a table that needs populated with example or default data.
Another use is a recovery load of data for tables that have a single
direction of synchronization. For example, a retail store records sales
transactions that synchronize in one direction by trickling back to the
central office. If the retail store needs to recover all the sales
transactions from the central office, they can be sent are part of an
initial load from the central office by setting up dead Triggers that

<title>Enabling "Ping Back"</title>

<para>
As discussed in
<xref linkend="defining-data-changes-trigger-routers-ping-back" />
SymmetricDS, by default, avoids circular data changes. When a trigger
fires as a result of SymmetricDS itself (such as the case when sync on
incoming batch is set), it records the originating source node of the
data change in
<literal>source_node_id</literal>
. During routing, if routing results in sending the data back to the
originating source node, the data is not routed by default. If instead
you wish to route the data back to the originating node, you can set the
<literal>ping_back_enabled</literal>
column for the needed particular trigger / router combination. This will
cause the router to "ping" the data back to the originating node when it
usually would not.

<title>Opening Registration</title>

<para>
Node registration is the act of setting up a new
<xref linkend="table_node" xrefstyle="table" />
and
<xref linkend="table_node_security" xrefstyle="table" />
so that when the new node is brought online it is allowed to join the
system. Nodes are only allowed to register if rows exist for the node
and the
<literal>registration_enabled</literal>
flag is set to 1. If the
<literal>auto.registration</literal>
SymmetricDS property is set to true, then when a node attempts to
register, if registration has not already occurred, the node will
automatically be registered.
</para>

<para>
SymmetricDS allows you to have multiple nodes with the same
<literal>external_id</literal>
. Out of the box, openRegistration will open a new registration if a
registration already exists for a node with the same external_id. A new
registration means a new node with a new
<literal>node_id</literal>
and the same
<literal>external_id</literal>
will be created. If you want to re-register the same node you can use
the

<section id="transform-data">
<title>Transforming Data</title>

<para>New as of SymmetricDS 2.4, SymmetricDS is now able to
transform synchronized data by way of configuration (previously, for
most cases a custom data loader would need to have been written). This
transformation can take place on a source node or on a target node, as
the data is being loaded or extracted. With this new feature you can,
for example:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Copy a column from a source table to two (or more) target
table columns,</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Merge columns from two or more source tables into a single
row in a target table,</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Insert constants in columns in target tables based on
source data synchronizations,</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Insert multiple rows of data into a single target table
based on one change in a source table,</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Apply a Bean Shell script to achieve a custom transform
when loading into the target database.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>These transformations can take place either on the target
or on the source, and as data is either being extracted or loaded. In
either case, the transformation is initiated due to existence of a
source synchronization trigger. The source trigger creates the
synchronization data, while the transformation configuration decides
what to do with the synchronization data as it is either being extracted
from the source or loaded into the target. You have the flexibility of
defining different transformation behavior depending on whether the
source change that triggered the synchronization was an Insert, Update,
or Delete. In the case of Delete, you even have options on what exactly
to do on the target side, be it a delete of a row, setting columns to
specific values, or absolutely nothing at all.</para>

<para>A few key concepts are important to keep in mind to
understand how SymmetricDS performs transformations. The first concept
is that of the "source operation" or "source DML type", which is the
type of operation that occurred to generate the synchronization data in
the first place (i.e., an insert, a delete, or an update). Your
transformations can be configured to act differently based on the source
DML type, if desired. When transforming, by default the DML action taken
on the target matches that of the action taken on the row in the source
(although this behavior can be altered through configuration if needed).
If the source DML type is an Insert, for example, the resulting
transformation DML(s) will be Insert(s).</para>

<para>Another important concept is the way in which transforms
are applied. Each source operation may map to one or more transforms and
result in one or more operations on the target tables. Each of these
target operations are performed as independent operations in sequence
and must be "complete" from a SQL perspective. In other words, you must
define columns for the transformation that are sufficient to fill in any
primary key or other required data in the target table if the source
operation was an Insert, for example.</para>

<para>Finally, please note that the transformation engine relies
on a source trigger / router existing to supply the source data for the
transformation. The transform configuration will never be used if the
source table and target node group does not have a defined trigger /
router combination for that source table and target node group.</para>

<section id="transform-data-tables">
<title>Transform Configuration Tables</title>

<para>
SymmetricDS stores its transformation configuration in two configuration
tables,
<xref linkend="table_transform_table" xrefstyle="table" />
and
<xref linkend="table_transform_column" xrefstyle="table" />
. Defining a transformation involves configuration in both tables, with
the first table defining which source and destination tables are
involved, and the second defining the columns involved in the
transformation and the behavior of the data for those columns. We will
explain the various options available in both tables and the various
pre-defined transformation types.
<!--  and then end with a series of examples.-->
</para>

<para>
To define a transformation, you will first define the source table and
target table that applies to a particular transformation. The source and
target tables, along with a unique identifier (the transform_id column)
are defined in
<xref linkend="table_transform_table" xrefstyle="table" />
. In addition, you will specify the source_node_group_id and
target_node_group_id to which the transform will apply, along with
whether the transform should occur on the Extract step or the Load step
(transform_point). All of these values are required.
</para>

<para>
Three additional configuration settings are also defined at the
source-target table level: the order of the transformations, the
behavior when deleting, and whether an update should always be attempted
first. More specifically,
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>transform_order: For a single source operation that
is mapped to a transformation, there could be more than one target
operation that takes place. You may control the order in which the
target operations are applied through a configuration parameter defined
for each source-target table combination. This might be important, for
example, if the foreign key relationships on the target tables require
you to execute the transformations in a particular order.</listitem>

<listitem>
column_policy: Indicates whether unspecified columns are passed thru or
if all columns must be explicitly defined. The options include:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>SPECIFIED - Indicates that only the transform
columns that are defined will be the ones that end up as part of the
transformation.</listitem>

<listitem>IMPLIED - Indicates that if not specified, then
columns from the source are passed through to the target. This is useful
if you just want to map a table from one name to anther or from one
schema to another. It is also useful if you want to transform a table,
but also want to pass it through. You would define an implied transform
from the source to the target and would not have to configure each
column.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>

<listitem>
delete_action: When a source operation of Delete takes place, there are
three possible ways to handle the transformation at the target. The
options include:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>NONE - The delete results in no target changes.</listitem>

<listitem>DEL_ROW - The delete results in a delete of the row
as specified by the pk columns defined in the transformation
configuration.</listitem>

<listitem>UPDATE_COL - The delete results in an Update
operation on the target which updates the specific rows and columns
based on the defined transformation.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>

<listitem>
update_first: This option overrides the default behavior for an Insert
operation. Instead of attempting the Insert first, SymmetricDS will
always perform an Update first and then fall back to an Insert if that
fails. Note that, by default, fall back logic
<emphasis>always</emphasis>
applies for Insert and Updates. Here, all you a specifying is whether to
always do an Update first, which can have performance benefits under
certain situations you may run into.
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
For each transformation defined in
<xref linkend="table_transform_table" xrefstyle="table" />
, the columns to be transformed (and how they are transformed) are
defined in
<xref linkend="table_transform_column" xrefstyle="table" />
. This column-level table typically has several rows for each
transformation id, each of which defines the source column name, the
target column name, as well as the following details:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>include_on: Defines whether this entry applies to
source operations of Insert (I), Update (U), or Delete (D), or any
source operation.</listitem>

<listitem>pk: Indicates that this mapping is used to define
the "primary key" for identifying the target row(s) (which may or may
not be the true primary key of the target table). This is used to define
the "where" clause when an Update or Delete on the target is occurring.
At least one row marked as a pk should be present for each transform_id.</listitem>

<listitem>transform_type, transform_expression: Specifies how
the data is modified, if at all. The available transform types are
discussed below, and the default is 'copy', which just copies the data
from source to target.</listitem>

<listitem>transform_order: In the event there are more than
one columns to transform, this defines the relative order in which the
transformations are applied.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
</section>

<section id="transform-data-types">
<title>Transformation Types</title>

<para>
There are several pre-defined transform types available in SymmetricDS.
Additional ones can be defined by creating and configuring an extension
point which implements the
<code>IColumnTransform</code>
interface. The pre-defined transform types include the following (the
transform_type entry is shown in parentheses):
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Copy Column Transform ('copy'): This transformation
type copies the source column value to the target column. This is the
default behavior.</listitem>

<listitem>Remove Column Transform ('remove'): This
transformation type removes the source column. This transform type is
only valid for a table transformation type of 'IMPLIED' where all the
columns from the source are automatically copied to the target.</listitem>

<listitem>Constant Transform ('const'): This transformation
type allows you to map a constant value to the given target column. The
constant itself is placed in transform_expression.</listitem>

<listitem>
Variable Transform ('variable'): This transformation type allows you to
map a built-in dynamic variable to the given target column. The variable
name is placed in transform_expression. The following variables are
available:
<code>system_date</code>
is the current system date,
<code>system_timestamp</code>
is the current system date and time,
<code>source_node_id</code>
is the node id of the source,
<code>target_node_id</code>
is the node id of the target,
<code>null</code>
is a null value, and <code>old_column_value</code> is the column's old value prior to the DML operation.
</listitem>

<listitem>Additive Transform ('additive'): This
transformation type is used for numeric data. It computes the change
between the old and new values on the source and then adds the change to
the existing value in the target column. That is, target = target +
multiplier (source_new - source_old), where multiplier is a constant
found in the transform_expression (default is 1 if not specified). For
example, if the source column changed from a 2 to a 4, the target column
is currently 10, and the multiplier is 3, the effect of the transform
will be to change the target column to a value of 16 ( 10+3*(4-2) =&gt;
16 ). Note that, in the case of deletes, the new column value is
considered 0 for the purposes of the calculation.</listitem>

<listitem>
Substring Transform ('substr'): This transformation computes a substring
of the source column data and uses the substring as the target column
value. The transform_expression can be a single integer (
<code>n</code>
, the beginning index), or a pair of comma-separated integers (
<code>n,m</code>
- the beginning and ending index). The transform behaves as the Java
substring function would using the specified values in
transform_expression.
</listitem>

<listitem>Multiplier Transform ('multiply'): This
transformation allows for the creation of multiple rows in the target
table based on the transform_expression. This transform type can only be
used on a primary key column. The transform_expression is a SQL
statement that returns the list to be used to create the multiple
targets.</listitem>

<listitem>Lookup Transform ('lookup'): This transformation
determines the target column value by using a query, contained in
transform_expression to lookup the value in another table. The query
must return a single row, and the first column of the query is used as
the value. Your query references source column names by prefixing with a
colon (e.g., :MY_COLUMN).</listitem>

<listitem>
Shell Script Transform ('bsh'): This transformation allows you to
provide a Bean Shell script in transform_expression and executes the
script at the time of transformation. Some variables are provided to the
script:
<code>COLUMN_NAME</code>
is a variable for a source column in the row, where the variable name is
the column name in uppercase;
<code>currentValue</code>
is the value of the current source column;
<code>oldValue</code>
is the old value of the source column for an updated row;
<code>sqlTemplate</code>
is a
<code>org.jumpmind.db.sql.ISqlTemplate</code>
object for querying or updating the database;
<code>channelId</code>
is a reference to the channel on which the transformation is happening;
<code>sourceNode</code>
is a
<code>org.jumpmind.symmetric.model.Node</code>
object that represents the node from where the data came;
<code>targetNode</code>
is a
<code>org.jumpmind.symmetric.model.Node</code>
object that represents the node where the data is being loaded.
</listitem>

<listitem>Identity Transform ('identity'): This
transformation allows you to insert into an identity column by computing
a new identity, not copying the actual identity value from the source.
</listitem>

<listitem>
Mathematical Transform ('math'): This transformation allows you to 
perform mathematical equations in the transform expression. Some 
variables are provided to the script:
<code>#{COLUMN_NAME}</code>
is a variable for a source column in the row, where the variable name
is the column name in uppercase;
<code>#{currentValue}</code>
is the value of the current source column;
<code>#{oldValue}</code>
is the old value of the source column for an updated row.
</listitem>


<listitem>
Value Map Transform ('valueMap'):  This transformation allows for simple value substitutions through use of the transform expression.
The transform expresion should consist of a space separated list of value pairs of the format sourceValue=TargetValue.  The column value is used to 
locate the correct sourceValue, and the transform will change the value into the corresponding targetValue.  A sourceValue of * can be used to
represent a default target value in the event that the sourceValue is not found.  Otherwise, if no default value is found,
the result will be null.  For example, consider the following transform expression:  s1=t1 s2=t2 s3=t3 *=t4.  A source value of
s1 will be transformed to t1, s2 to t2, s3 to t3, s4 to t4, s5 to t4, null to t4, etc.

<title>Data Load Filters</title>

<para>
New as of SymmetricDS 3.1, SymmetricDS is now capable of taking actions
upon the load of certain data via configurable load filters. This new
configurable option is in additon to the already existing option of
writing a class that implements
<xref linkend="extensions-data-loader-filter" xrefstyle="table" />
. A configurable load filter watches for specific data that is being
loaded and then takes action based on the load of that data.
</para>

<para>Specifying which data to action is done by specifying a
souce and target node group (data extracted from this node group, and
loaded into that node group), and a target catalog, schema and table
name. You can decide to take action on rows that are inserted, updated
and/or deleted, and can also further delineate which rows of the target
table to take action on by specifying additional criteria in the bean
shell script that is executed in response to the loaded data. As an
example, old and new values for the row of data being loaded are
available in the bean shell script, so you can action rows with a
certain column value in old or new data.</para>

<para>The action taken is based on a bean shell script that you
can provide as part of the configuration. Actions can be taken at
different points in the load process including before write, after
write, at batch complete, at batch commit and/or at batch rollback.</para>

Work done by SymmetricDS is initiated by jobs. Jobs are tasks that are
started and scheduled by a job manager. Jobs are enabled by the

runs in controlled by one of two properties:
<literal>job.{name}.period.time.ms</literal>
or
<literal>job.{name}.cron</literal>
. If a valid cron property exists in the configuration, then it will be
used to schedule the job. Otherwise, the job manager will attempt to use
the period.time.ms property.

<para>
SymmetricDS utilizes Spring's CRON support, which includes seconds as
the first parameter. This differs from the typical Unix-based
implementation, where the first parameter is usually minutes. For
example,
<literal>*/15 * * * * *</literal>
means every 15 seconds, not every 15 minutes. See

Some jobs cannot be run in parallel against a single node. When running
on a cluster these jobs use the
<xref linkend="table_lock" xrefstyle="table" />
table to get an exclusive semaphore to run the job. In order to use this
table the
<ns:literal>cluster.lock.enabled</ns:literal>
must be set to true.
</para>
<para> The three main jobs in SymmetricDS are the route, push and
pull jobs. The route job decides what captured data changes should be
sent to which nodes. It also decides what captured data changes should
be transported and loaded together in a batch. The push and pull jobs
are responsible for initiating HTTP communication with linked nodes to
push or pull data changes that have been routed. </para>

<section id="routing-job">
<title>Route Job</title>
<para>
After data is captured in the
<xref linkend="table_data" xrefstyle="table" />
table, it is routed to specific nodes in batches by the
<emphasis>Route Job</emphasis>
. It is a single background task that inserts into
<xref linkend="table_data_event" xrefstyle="table" />
and
<xref linkend="table_outgoing_batch" xrefstyle="table" />

</para>
<para>
The job processes each enabled channel, one at a time, collecting a list
of data ids from
<xref linkend="table_data" xrefstyle="table" />
which have not been routed (see
<xref linkend="data-gaps" />
for much more detail about this step), up to a limit specified by the
channel configuration (
<literal>max_data_to_route</literal>

<ns:literal>source_node_group_id</ns:literal>
that matches the current node's source node group id and is linked to
the
<xref linkend="table_trigger" xrefstyle="table" />

data should be sent to. Data can only be routed to nodes that belong to
the router's
<ns:literal>target_node_group_id</ns:literal>
.

<section id="data-gaps">
<title>Data Gaps</title>
<para>
On the surface, the first Route Job step of collecting unrouted data ids
seems simple: assign sequential data ids for each data row as it's
inserted and keep track of which data id was last routed and start from
there. The difficulty arises, however, due to the fact that there can be
multiple transactions inserting into
<xref linkend="table_data" xrefstyle="table" />
simultaneously. As such, a given section of rows in the
<xref linkend="table_data" xrefstyle="table" />
table may actually contain "gaps" in the data ids when the Route Job is
executing. Most of these gaps are only temporarily and fill in at some
point after routing and need to be picked up with the next run of the
Route Job. Thus, the Route Job needs to remember to route the filled-in
gaps. Worse yet, some of these gaps are actually permanent and result
from a transaction that is rolled back for some reason. In this case,
the Route Job must continue to watch for the gap to fill in and, at some
point, eventually gives up and assumes the gap is permanent and can be
skipped. All of this must be done in some fashion that guarantees that
gaps are routed when they fill in while also keeping routing as
efficient as possible.
</para>
<para>
SymmetricDS handles the issue of data gaps by making use of a table,
<xref linkend="table_data_gap" xrefstyle="table" />
, to record gaps found in the data ids. In fact, this table completely
defines the entire range of data tha can be routed at any point in time.
For a brand new instance of SymmetricDS, this table is empty and
SymmetricDS creates a gap starting from data id of zero and ending with
a very large number (defined by
<literal>routing.largest.gap.size</literal>
). At the start of a Route Job, the list of valid gaps (gaps with status
of 'GP') is collected, and each gap is evaluated in turn. If a gap is
sufficiently old (as defined by
<literal>routing.stale.dataid.gap.time.ms</literal>
, the gap is marked as skipped (status of 'SK') and will no longer be
evaluated in future Route Jobs (note that the 'last' gap (the one with
the highest starting data id) is never skipped). If not skipped, then
<xref linkend="table_data_event" xrefstyle="table" />
is searched for data ids present in the gap. If one or more data ids is
found in
<xref linkend="table_data_event" xrefstyle="table" />
, then the current gap is marked with a status of OK, and new gap(s) are
created to represent the data ids still missing in the gap's range. This
process is done for all gaps. If the very last gap contained data, a new
gap starting from the highest data id and ending at (highest data id +
<literal>routing.largest.gap.size</literal>
) is then created. This process has resulted in an updated list of gaps
which may contain new data to be routed.

<section id="push-pull-job">
<title>Push and Pull Jobs for Database changes</title>
<para>
After database-change data is routed, it awaits transport to the target nodes. Transport
can occur when a client node is configured to pull data or when the host
node is configured to push data. These events are controlled by the
<emphasis>push</emphasis>
and the
<emphasis>pull jobs</emphasis>
. When the
<literal>start.pull.job</literal>
SymmetricDS property is set to
<literal>true</literal>
, the frequency that data is pulled is controlled by the
<literal>job.pull.period.time.ms</literal>
. When the
<literal>start.push.job</literal>
SymmetricDS property is set to
<literal>true</literal>
, the frequency that data is pushed is controlled by the
<literal>job.push.period.time.ms</literal>
.
</para>
<para>
Data is extracted by channel from the source database's
<xref linkend="table_data" xrefstyle="table" />
table at an interval controlled by the
<literal>extract_period_millis</literal>
column on the
<xref linkend="table_channel" xrefstyle="table" />
table. The
<literal>last_extract_time</literal>
is always recorded, by channel, on the
<xref linkend="table_node_channel_ctl" xrefstyle="table" />
table for the host node's id. When the Pull and Push Job run, if the
extract period has not passed according to the last extract time, then
the channel will be skipped for this run. If the
<literal>extract_period_millis</literal>
is set to zero, data extraction will happen every time the jobs run.
</para>
<para>
The maximum number of batches to extract per synchronization is
controlled by
<ns:literal>max_batch_to_send</ns:literal>
on the
<xref linkend="table_channel" xrefstyle="table" />
table. There is also a setting that controls the max number of bytes to
send in one synchronization. If SymmetricDS has extracted the more than
the number of bytes configured by the
<ns:literal>transport.max.bytes.to.sync</ns:literal>
parameter, then it will finish extracting the current batch and finish
synchronization so the client has a chance to process and acknowlege the
"big" batch. This may happen before the configured max number of batches
has been reached.
</para>
<para>
Both the push and pull jobs can be configured to push and pull multiple
nodes in parallel. In order to take advantage of this the
<literal>pull.thread.per.server.count</literal>
or
<literal>push.thread.per.server.count</literal>
should be adjusted (from their default value of 10) to the number to the
number of concurrent push/pulls you want to occur per period on each
SymmetricDS instance. Push and pull activity is recorded in the
<xref linkend="table_node_communication" xrefstyle="table" />
table. This table is also used to lock push and pull activity across
multiple servers in a cluster.
</para>
<para>
SymmetricDS also provides the ability to configure windows of time when
synchronization is allowed. This is done using the
<xref linkend="table_node_group_channel_wnd" xrefstyle="table" />
table. A list of allowed time windows can be specified for a node group
and a channel. If one or more windows exist, then data will only be
extracted and transported if the time of day falls within the window of
time specified. The configured times are always for the target node's
local time. If the
<literal>start_time</literal>
is greater than the
<literal>end_time</literal>
, then the window crosses over to the next day.
</para>
<para>
All data loading may be disabled by setting the
<literal>dataloader.enable</literal>
property to false. This has the effect of not allowing incoming
synchronizations, while allowing outgoing synchronizations. All data
extractions may be disabled by setting the
<literal>dataextractor.enable</literal>
property to false. These properties can be controlled by inserting into
the root server's
<xref linkend="table_parameter" xrefstyle="table" />
table. These properties affect every channel with the exception of the
'config' channel.

<title>File Sync Push and Pull Jobs</title>
<para>
The File Sync Push and Pull jobs (introduced in version 3.5) are responsible for synchronizing file changes.
These jobs work with batches on the <literal>filesync</literal> channel and create ZIP files of changed files
to be sent and applied on other nodes.
The parameters <literal>job.file.sync.push.period.time.ms</literal> and <literal>job.file.sync.pull.period.time.ms</literal>
control how often the jobs runs, which default to every 60 seconds.

<section id="file-sync-tracker-job">
<title>File System Tracker Job</title>
<para>
The File System Tracker job (introduced in version 3.5) is responsible for monitoring and
recording the events of files being created, modified, or deleted.
It records the current state of files to the <xref linkend="table_file_snapshot" xrefstyle="table" /> table.
The parameter <literal>job.file.sync.tracker.cron</literal> controls how often the job runs,
which defaults to every 5 minutes.

<section id="sync-triggers">
<title>Sync Triggers Job</title>
<para>
SymmetricDS examines the current configuration, corresponding database
triggers, and the underlying tables to determine if database triggers
need created or updated. The change activity is recorded on the
<xref linkend="table_trigger_hist" xrefstyle="table" />
table with a reason for the change. The following reasons for a change
are possible:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>N - New trigger that has not been created before</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>S - Schema changes in the table were detected</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>C - Configuration changes in Trigger</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>T - Trigger was missing</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

A configuration entry in Trigger without any history in Trigger Hist
results in a new trigger being created (N). The Trigger Hist stores a
hash of the underlying table, so any alteration to the table causes the
trigger to be rebuilt (S). When the
<literal>last_update_time</literal>
is changed on the Trigger entry, the configuration change causes the
trigger to be rebuilt (C). If an entry in Trigger Hist is missing the
corresponding database trigger, the trigger is created (T).
</para>
<para>
The process of examining triggers and rebuilding them is automatically
run during startup and each night by the SyncTriggersJob. The user can
also manually run the process at any time by invoking the
<literal>syncTriggers()</literal>
method over JMX.
</para>
</section>
<section id="purge-job">
<title>Purge Jobs</title>
<para>
Purging is the act of cleaning up captured data that is no longer needed
in SymmetricDS's runtime tables. Data is purged through delete
statements by the
<emphasis>Purge Job</emphasis>
. Only data that has been successfully synchronized will be purged.
Purged tables include:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<xref linkend="table_data" xrefstyle="table" />
</listitem>
<listitem>
<xref linkend="table_data_event" xrefstyle="table" />

</listitem>
<listitem>
<xref linkend="table_node_host_job_stats" xrefstyle="table" />
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
The purge job is enabled by the
<literal>start.purge.job</literal>
SymmetricDS property. The timing of the three purge jobs (incoming,
outgoing, and data gaps) is controlled by a cron expression as specified
by the following properties:
<literal>job.purge.outgoing.cron</literal>
,
<literal>job.purge.incoming.cron</literal>
, and
<literal>job.purge.datagaps.cron</literal>
. The default is
<literal>0 0 0 * * *</literal>
, or once per day at midnight.
</para>

<para>
Two retention period properties indicate how much history SymmetricDS
will retain before purging. The
<literal>purge.retention.minutes</literal>
property indicates the period of history to keep for synchronization
tables. The default value is 5 days. The
<literal>statistic.retention.minutes</literal>
property indicates the period of history to keep for statistics. The
default value is also 5 days.
</para>
<para> The purge properties should be adjusted according to how
much data is flowing through the system and the amount of storage space
the database has. For an initial deployment it is recommended that the
purge properties be kept at the defaults, since it is often helpful to
be able to look at the captured data in order to triage problems and
profile the synchronization patterns. When scaling up to more nodes, it
is recomended that the purge parameters be scaled back to 24 hours or
less. </para>
