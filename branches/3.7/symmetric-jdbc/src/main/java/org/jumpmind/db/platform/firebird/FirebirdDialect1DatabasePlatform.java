 * Firebird has two SQL dialect modes: mode 3 is the default modern sql dialect, while mode 1 is the compatibility
 * mode for moving to Firebird from an older Interbase 6 database.  Maybe we should have an isDialect1 boolean instead, since this
 * mode is available on any version of Firebird.  The JdbcDatabasePlatformFactory currently runs query tests to determine
 * which sql dialect mode is being used, in order to get the right IDatabasePlatform.
