=== Greenplum

Greenplum is a data warehouse based on PostgreSQL. It is supported as a target platform in SymmetricDS.

SymmetricDS has bulk loading capability available for Greenplum. SymmetricDS specifies data loader types 
on a channel by channel basis. To utilize Greenplum Bulk loading versus straight JDBC insert, specify the 
Postgres Bulk Loader ("postgres_bulk") in the data_loader_type column of sym_channel.
