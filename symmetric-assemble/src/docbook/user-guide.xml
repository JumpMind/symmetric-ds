            SymmetricDS is an open-source, web-enabled, database independent, data synchronization software application. It uses
            web and database technologies to replicate tables between relational databases in near
            real time. The software was designed to scale for a large number of databases, work
            across low-bandwidth connections, and withstand periods of network outages.

        <para>
            This User Guide introduces SymmetricDS and its uses for data synchronization. It is
            intended for users who want to be quickly familiarized with the software, configure it,
            and use its many features.  This version of the guide was generated on <?dbtimestamp format="Y-m-d"?> at <?dbtimestamp format="H:M:S"?>.
