=== DBCompare

The DbCompare utility provides the ability to compare two SQL-based data sources and output a report of the differences, and optionally generate SQL to bring the target into sync with the source.

ifdef::pro[]
The dbcompare wizard is accessible for multi-homed nodes from the explore tab of the pro console.  
The pop-up window asks for source and target engines for the comparison as well as the the tables to be compared.

The next window allows specific tables to be selected for comparison.

The results of the compare can be presented in four ways:

. Show Report
. Write Differences to SQL Editor
. Write Differences to File
. Apply Differences to Target Tables

The *Show Report* option will open a new tab in the SQL editor showing the results of the compare.

The *Write Differences to SQL Editor* option will write all the required SQL to get the tables in sync and copy it to the current instance of the SQL editor.

The *Write Differences to File* option will write the required SQL to get the tables in sync to the file system.

The *Write Differences to Target Tables* option will automatically execute the SQL necessary to bring the tables into sync.

The dbcompare utility can be run directly from the command line.
The dbcompare command is as follows:
[source]
----
dbcompare (tablename...) <optional-arguments>
----

A table name or list of comma separated table names must be included in order for dbcompare to work properly. The *dbcompare (tablename...)* can be followed by any optional parameters from the command line in the bin directory of the Symmetric instance.  
The *--help* option will display all the possible configurable parameters for the compare utility.
Possible options include:

- *--config <arg>* : A reference to a properties file path containing additional configuration arguments for dbcompare. This properties file allows you to include table specific configuration and specify arguments such as where_clause, order_by_suffix, and exclude_columns. Where clauses in the file should be formatted as [table].[source|target].where_clause. For example, with a table called item, use item.where_clause=field > now()-2. If you do not specify a table before "where_clause", then it will be used on all tables. The same concept applies to order by suffixes, which can also include a column name formatted as [table].[column].[source|target].order_by_suffix.

** Example of config properties file:

- *--date-time-format <arg>*: The format to be used when comparing date time values. For example, using the format 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss' would convert date time values into yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss and then compare.
- *--exclude <arg>* : A comma-separated list of table names to exclude from comparison.
- *-h, --help* : Print help with each option and description.
- *--numeric-scale <arg>* : When comparing decimals, how many decimal places to consider while doing the comparison.  Remaining digits will be rounded.  Default value is 3.
- *--output-sql <arg>* : An output file for SQL statements that if executed on the target, should bring it into sync with the source.
- *-s, --source* : The source database engine properties file for comparison.
- *-t, --target <arg>* : The target database engine properties file for comparison.
- *--use-sym-config <arg>* : true|false.  If true, sym_trigger, sym_transform, etc. will be consulted to build up the data model to compare, and the tablename argument is no longer required, but if tablename is provided it will only compare the matching tables. Default is false.

An example DbCompare results table is shown below:

The results table gives info from the compare as table columns.  The data includes the number of rows *Matched*, *Different*, *Missing*, and *Extra* between the two source and target tables.
