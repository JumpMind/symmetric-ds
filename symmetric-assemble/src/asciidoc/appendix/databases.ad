=== Compatibility

Each database management system has its own characteristics that results in
feature coverage in SymmetricDS.  The following table shows which features are available
by database.

Database *:: Asterisk (*) next to database indicates the database support is available in https://www.jumpmind.com/products/symmetricds/symmetricds-overview[SymmetricDS Pro] only.

Transaction Identifier:: A transaction identifier is recorded in the SYM_DATA table along with changes, which allows changes in the same transaction to be grouped
together for commit within a batch.

Data Capture:: Changes to tables can be captured using database triggers.

Conditional Sync:: Conditions can be specified on SYM_TRIGGER, which are compiled into the trigger to decide if a change should be captured.

Update Loop Prevention:: The remote node is recorded on data that is captured, so the system can prevent the changes from being sent back to the same node. 

BLOB Sync:: Binary large object data can be captured or streamed from the database.

CLOB Sync:: Character large object data can be captured or streamed from the database.

=== Catalog and Schema

A relational database may be divided into catalogs that contain sub-databases called schemas, which contain tables.
Each database management system can implement the concepts of catalog and schema differently or not at all.
When locating a table, SymmetricDS uses the default catalog and schema unless the user specifies one.
