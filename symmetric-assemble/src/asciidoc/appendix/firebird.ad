=== Firebird

Use `symadmin module install firebird` to install driver files, or copy your own files into the `lib` sub-directory.

The Firebird Dialect may require the installation of a User Defined Function (UDF) library in order to provide functionality 
needed by the database triggers.  SymmetricDS includes the required UDF library, called SYM_UDF, in both source form (as a C program) 
and as pre-compiled libraries for both Windows and Linux.  For Firebird 2.0 and earlier, the UDF is needed for capturing character
and BLOB types, so the dialect will not allow startup if the UDF is missing.
For Firebird 2.1 and later, the UDF is only needed for capturing BLOB types, so installation may not be necessary and the dialect does not
check for it. 

Download the https://sourceforge.net/projects/symmetricds/files/symmetricds-extras/firebird-udf-1.2.zip/download[SymmetricDS UDF Library]
if it is required for your use case.
The SYM_UDF library is copied into the UDF folder within the Firebird installation directory.

For Linux users:

*cp firebird/sym_udf.so /opt/firebird/UDF*

For Windows users:

*copy firebird\sym_udf.dll C:\Program Files\Firebird\Firebird_X_Y\UDF*

The following limitations currently exist for this dialect:

. The outgoing batch does not honor the channel size, and all outstanding data events are included in a batch.

. Syncing of Binary Large Object (BLOB) is limited to 16KB per column.

. Syncing of character data is limited to 32KB per column.  The overall row size of a resultset cannot
exceed 64KB.  For change capture, the row_data and old_data are limited to 10KB and and the pk_data is limited to 500 bytes
for performance reasons.  If you get the error of "arithmetic exception, numeric overflow, or string truncation" during
extraction of a batch, set the contains_big_lob to true for the channel.

Firebird 3 is supported, however legacy authentication must be enabled in order to connect.  Please refer to the Firebird 3.0 documentation for instructions on enabling this feature.

==== Bulk Loading

SymmetricDS has bulk loading capability available for Firebird, when registering a Firebird database with SymmetricDS, bulk loading will be checked by default. SymmetricDS specifies data loader types on a channel by channel basis. Once you have your database registered, to utilize bulk loading versus straight JDBC insert, specify the Bulk Loader ("bulk") in the data_loader_type column of sym_channel table.
