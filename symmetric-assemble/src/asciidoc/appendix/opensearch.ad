Use `symadmin module install opensearch` to install driver files, or copy your own files into the `lib` sub-directory.

Send changes from your relational database to OpenSearch in a variety of formats.  An OpenSearch node can be setup as a <<Write Only Node>> to receive changes from another node that is capturing changes.

Setup the OpenSearch node by using the <<Add Node,Connect Database>> wizard and selecting OpenSearch as the type.   The URL will be the connection point to OpenSearch.  User and password are not needed (or used).

==== Bulk Loading


===== Setup reload channels for bulk loading.

Update any reload channels that will be used on the table triggers that will capture changes and send them to OpenSearch by setting the column data_loader_type to 'bulk'.  It is also recommended to increase the batch size so that larger CSV files will be processed instead of the default size on reloads of 10,000 rows.
