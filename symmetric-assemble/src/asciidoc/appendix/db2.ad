=== DB2

Use `symadmin module install db2` to install driver files, or copy your own files into the `lib` sub-directory.

The IBM DB2 Dialect uses global variables to enable and disable node and trigger synchronization. 
These variables are created automatically during the first startup. The DB2 JDBC driver should be placed in the "lib" folder.

Currently, the DB2 Dialect for SymmetricDS does not provide support for transactional synchronization. 
Large objects (LOB) are supported, but are limited to 16,336 bytes in size. The current features in the DB2 
Dialect have been tested using DB2 9.5 on Linux and Windows operating systems.

There is currently a bug with the retrieval of auto increment columns with the DB2 9.5 JDBC drivers that causes some 
of the SymmetricDS configuration tables to be rebuilt when auto.config.database=true. The DB2 9.7 JDBC drivers seem 
to have fixed the issue. They may be used with the 9.5 database.

A system temporary tablespace with too small of a page size may cause the following trigger build errors:

----
SQL1424N Too many references to transition variables and transition table
columns or the row length for these references is too long. Reason
code="2". LINE NUMBER=1. SQLSTATE=54040
----
     
         
Simply create a system temporary tablespace that has a bigger page size. A page size of 8k will probably suffice.

[source, SQL]  
----
CREATE BUFFERPOOL tmp_bp PAGESIZE 8k;

CREATE SYSTEM TEMPORARY TABLESPACE tmp_tbsp       
     PAGESIZE 8K
     MANAGED BY SYSTEM  
     USING ('/home/db2inst1/tmp_tbsp')
	 BUFFERPOOL tmp_bp

By default DB2 will not capture the transaction id associated with the captured data.   This can be turned on with the following parameter.

db2.capture.transaction.id=false

=== DB2 for IBM i

ifndef::pro[]
NOTE: Support for DB2 for IBM i is available in https://www.jumpmind.com/products/symmetricds/symmetricds-overview[SymmetricDS Pro].
endif::pro[]

Use `symadmin module install db2` to install driver files, or copy your own files into the `lib` sub-directory.

The DB2 for IBM i dialect can connect to a database on IBM iSeries (AS/400) machines.  It was tested with the
http://jt400.sourceforge.net/[jt400 JDBC driver], which is already included in the SymmetricDS download.
Here is an example JDBC URL:

----
jdbc:as400://hostname/myschema
----

The "libraries" parameter may be used in some cases to resolve unqualified object names:

----
jdbc:as400://hostname/;libraries=myschema
----

WARNING: The tables created by SymmetricDS must have journaling enabled for commitment control.

==== Auto Journaling

The SymmetricDS library will be automatically journaled if it is created using the `CREATE SCHEMA` or `CREATE COLLECTION` SQL commands.

Otherwise, journaling can be enabled for new tables automatically by creating a default journal named `QSQJRN` in the library.
The following steps add automatic journaling to the "sym" library (change it to your library) using the OS/400 command line: 

* Create the journal receiver object: 

----
CRTJRNRCV JRNRCV(sym/symjrnrcv)
----

* Create the journal object: 

----
CRTJRN JRN(sym/QSQJRN) JRNRCV(sym/symjrnrcv)
----


==== Manual Journaling

Using automatic journaling for the SymmetricDS library is the preferred method, but journaling can also
be enabled for each table manually.
After starting SymmetricDS for the first time, it will connect to the database and create the required tables.
Then it will log an error message that journaling needs to be enabled for its tables.
The following steps add journaling to the "sym" library (change it to your library) using the OS/400 command line:

* Create a journal receiver object:
----
CRTJRNRCV JRNRCV(sym/symjrnrcv)
----

* Create a journal object:
----
CRTJRN JRN(sym/symjrn) JRNRCV(sym/symjrnrcv) 
----

* Start journaling:
----
STRJRNPF FILE(sym/SYM_C00001) JRN(sym/symjrn)
----

This step needs to be repeated for each physical file (table) created by SymmetricDS.
A single command can be run for all tables at once, like this:

----
CALL QCMD
<hit F11 for more lines>

STRJRNPF FILE(sym/SYM_C00001 sym/SYM_C00002 sym/SYM_C00003 sym/SYM_C00004 sym/SYM_C00005 sym/SYM_C00006 sym/SYM_D00001 sym/SYM_D00002 sym/SYM_DATA sym/SYM_E00001 sym/SYM_E00002 sym/SYM_F00001 sym/SYM_F00002 sym/SYM_F00003 sym/SYM_F00004 sym/SYM_G00001 sym/SYM_G00002 sym/SYM_I00005 sym/SYM_I00008 sym/SYM_L00001 sym/SYM_LOCK sym/SYM_M00001 sym/SYM_M00002 sym/SYM_N00001 sym/SYM_N00002 sym/SYM_N00003 sym/SYM_N00004 sym/SYM_N00005 sym/SYM_N00006 sym/SYM_N00007 sym/SYM_N00008 sym/SYM_N00009 sym/SYM_N00010 sym/SYM_N00011 sym/SYM_N00012 sym/SYM_NODE sym/SYM_O00001 sym/SYM_P00001 sym/SYM_R00001 sym/SYM_R00002 sym/SYM_ROUTER sym/SYM_S00001 sym/SYM_T00001 sym/SYM_T00002 sym/SYM_T00003 sym/SYM_T00004 sym/SYM_T00005 sym/SYM_T00006 sym/SYM_T00007) JRN(sym/symjrn)

==== Log Based 

Log based capture for DB2 for IBM iSeries uses a journal to read changes.   The journal that is used to read changes must have USE permission by the SymmetricDS user.

Also the journal must be setup to for BOTH before and after image data if you old data is required during replication or if primary key updates are to be replicated.

endif::pro[]

==== Capturing Old Data

In order for SymmetricDS to capture old data for updates, the `IMAGES(*BOTH)` journaling attribute must be specified. One way to specify this attribute is by running the following command:

----
CHGJRNOBJ OBJ((sym/SYM_C00001 *FILE)) ATR(*IMAGES) IMAGES(*BOTH)
----



=== DB2 for IBM z/OS

ifndef::pro[]
NOTE: Support for DB2 for IBM z/OS is available in https://www.jumpmind.com/products/symmetricds/symmetricds-overview[SymmetricDS Pro].
endif::pro[]

Use `symadmin module install db2` to install driver files, or copy your own files into the `lib` sub-directory.

To access DB2 z/OS, you will need the respective DB2 Connect license activated on the mainframe.
