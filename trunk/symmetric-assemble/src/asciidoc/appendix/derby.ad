=== Derby

The Apache Derby database can be run as an embedded database that is accessed by an application or 
a standalone server that can be accessed from the network. This dialect implementation creates 
database triggers that make method calls into Java classes. This means that the supporting JAR 
files need to be in the classpath when running Derby as a standalone database, which includes 
symmetric-ds.jar and commons-lang.jar.
