=== Wizard: Quick Config

The configuration wizard is responsible for setting up the necessary SymmetricDS components with their 
`default settings` to configure synchronization.   Behind the scenes it will create the appropriate 
triggers and link them based on the selections.

NOTE: The quick config wizard will show a screen for each router that is in place.  The below example
shows the profile "Standard 2 Tier" with a client and server.

==== Router 1: Client to Server

Select all tables that should be synchronized in the direction
stated in the header, in this case its `CLIENT` to the `SERVER`

==== Router 2: Server to Client

Next we will select tables to sync from the `SERVER` to the `CLIENT`. 

NOTE: The `item_selling_price` table was selected on both wizard screens so this table
will be configured for `bi-directional` sync.

TIP: Once the quick config wizard has completed your setup you can still navigate
to the specific components created to provide customizations beyond the default 
settings.
