==== Export

Export your configuration at any time through the web console.   Use the drop down to select the format you would like to use for the export.


Exporting your configuration might be useful in order to save a configuration in source control or to be used as an import 
into another environment.  Export and Import are frequently used to migrate configuration between test and production environments.
