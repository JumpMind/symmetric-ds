=== Group Links
Group links define at a high level how data moves throughout your synchronization scenario.  The group link defines
which node groups will synchronize data to other node groups and within that exchange, which node group will
initiate the conversation for that exchange.

.Required Fields

Source Group ID:: The source group of the communication link.
Link:: Defines how the source and target groups will communicate.

.Options for Group Links
|===

|Push [P]|Indicates that nodes in the source node group will initiate communication over an HTTP PUT and push data to nodes in the target node group.

|Wait for Pull [W]|Indicates nodes in the source node group will wait for a node in the target node group to connect via an HTTP GET and allow 
the nodes in the target node group to pull data from the nodes in the source node group.

|Route-only [R]|Route-only indicates that the data isn't exchanged between nodes in the source and nodes in the target node groups via SymmetricDS.  
This action type might be useful when using an XML publishing router or an audit table changes router.

|===

Target Group ID:: The target group of the communication link.

Sync Configuration:: Determines if configuration is also sent through this group link.  By default this is checked and configuration will communicate on this path.  There are configurations that might cause configuration to continuously loop through the network as a result this might need to be unchecked for some links.


.Sample Group Links

[source,sql]

insert into SYM_NODE_GROUP_LINK
(source_node_group, target_node_group, data_event_action) 
      values ('store', 'corp', 'P');
       
insert into SYM_NODE_GROUP_LINK
(source_node_group, target_node_group, data_event_action) 
      values ('corp', 'store', 'W');

[horizontal]
Basic:: Common two tier corp and store store bi-directional setup

Firewall:: All communication is initiated from corp group.  This is a common way to setup synchronization when the corp group is behind a firewall.

Peer to Peer::  Allows a node to sync to all other nodes in the same group.

Loop:: Turn sync configuration off on group link c to a so that configuration does not loop.

.Group Links Tips and Tricks
NOTE: The link also defines if configuration data will be synchronized on the link.  For example, you might not want remote nodes to be able to change configuration and effect other nodes in the network.  In this case you would uncheck sync configuration.

NOTE: Turn off sync configuration option where appropriate in non hierarchical setup so that configuration changes to not create a loop.  See "No Config" example above.
