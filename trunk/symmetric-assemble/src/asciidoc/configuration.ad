== Configuration

Configuring SymmetricDS is the process of setting up your synchronization scenario.  

ifdef::pro[]

The Configure Overview screen provides a summary of what is currently configured in this master node.
The main table on this screen shows configuration elements (Groups, Group Links, Routers, etc.) and the number of items
configured for each element.  As an example, in the sample screenshot below, there are 2 Groups defined, 2 Group Links
defined, 2 Routers defined, 9 Channels, defined, etc.  Certain configuration elements are required to configure the 
synchronization scenario.  If these elements are not configured, a warning symbol will be displayed next to the element name.

In addition to using the <<Wizard: Quick Config>> to configure the synchronization solution, you can also configure SymmetricDS
configuration elements one by one using the links on the left hand side of the Configure Overview screen.  Each configuration
element is described in the following sections of this guide.

Configuration can also be imported from and exported to external files by pressing the <<Import>> and <<Export>> buttons 
from the Configure Overview screen.
