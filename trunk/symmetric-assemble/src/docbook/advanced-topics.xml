        <title>Bi-Directional Synchronization</title>
        <para>
            SymmetricDS allows tables to be synchronized bi-directionally.  Note that an outgoing
            synchronization does not process changes during an incoming synchronization on the same node unless the trigger
            was created with the <literal>sync_on_incoming_batch</literal> flag set.  If the <literal>sync_on_incoming_batch</literal> flag
            is set, then update loops are prevented by a feature that is available in most database dialects.
            More specifically, during an incoming synchronization the source <literal>node_id</literal> is put into a database session variable that is
            available to the database trigger.  Data events are not generated if the target <literal>node_id</literal>
            on an outgoing synchronization is equal to the source <literal>node_id</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
            By default, only the columns that changed will be updated in the target system.

        <title>Multi-Tiered Synchronization</title>
        <para>
            As shown in <xref linkend="organizing-nodes"/>, there may be
            scenarios where data needs to flow through multiple tiers of nodes that
            are organized in a tree-like network with each tier requiring a different subset of data.  For example,
            you may have a system where the lowest tier may be a computer or device located in a store.  Those devices
            may connect to a server located physically at that store.  Then the store server may communicate with
            a corporate server for example.  In this case, the three tiers would be device, store, and corporate.
            Each tier is typically represented by a node group.  Each node in
            the tier would belong to the node group representing that tier.
        </para>
        <para>
            A node can only pull and push data to other nodes that are represented in the node's <xref linkend="table_node" xrefstyle="table"/>
            table and in cases where that node's <literal>sync_enabled</literal> column is set to 1.
            Because of this, a tree-like
            hierarchy of nodes can be created by having only a subset of nodes belonging to the same node group represented at the different branches of the tree.
        </para>
        <para>
            If auto registration is turned <emphasis>off</emphasis>, then this setup must occur manually by opening registration
            for the desired nodes at the desired parent node and by configuring each node's <literal>registration.url</literal>
             to be the parent node's URL.
            The parent node is always tracked by the setting of the parent's <literal>node_id</literal> in the <literal>created_at_node_id</literal> column of the new node.
            When a node registers and downloads its configuration it is always provided the configuration for nodes
            that might register with the node itself based on the Node Group Links defined in the parent node.
        </para>


    <section id='registration-redirect'>
        <title>Registration Redirect</title>
        <para>
            When deploying a multi-tiered system it may be advantageous to have only one registration server, even though the parent node of a registering node
            could be any of a number of nodes in the system.  In SymmetricDS the parent node is always the node that a child registers with.  The
            <xref linkend="table_registration_redirect" xrefstyle="table"/> table allows a single node, usually the root server in the network, to
            redirect registering nodes to their true parents.  It does so based on a mapping found in the table of the external id (<literal>registrant_external_id</literal>) to the parent's node
            id (<literal>registration_node_id</literal>).
        </para>
        <para>
            For example, if it is desired to have a series of regional servers that workstations at retail stores get assigned to based on their <literal>external_id</literal>, the store number, then
            you might insert into <xref linkend="table_registration_redirect" xrefstyle="table"/> the store number as the <literal>registrant_external_id</literal> and the <literal>node_id</literal> of
            the assigned region as the <literal>registration_node_id</literal>.  When a workstation at the store registers, the root server sends an HTTP redirect to the <literal>sync_url</literal> of the node
            that matches the <literal>registration_node_id</literal>.
        </para>
        <important>
            <para>Please see <xref linkend="configuration-initial-load" /> for important details around initial loads
            and registration when using registration redirect.

        <title>JMS Publishing</title>
        <para>
            With the proper configuration SymmetricDS can publish XML messages of captured data changes to
            JMS during routing or transactionally while data loading synchronized data into a target database.
            The following explains how to publish to JMS during synchronization to the target database.
       </para>
       <para>
            The XmlPublisherDatabaseWriterFilter is a
            <xref linkend="extensions-data-loader-filter" xrefstyle="table"/> that may be configured to
            publish specific tables as an XML message to a JMS provider.
            See <xref linkend="extensions"/> for information on how
            to configure an extension point.  If the publish to JMS fails, the batch will be marked in error,
            the loaded data for the batch will be rolled back
            and the batch will be retried during the next synchronization run.
        </para>
        <para>
        The following is an example extension point configuration that will publish four tables in XML with a root
        tag of <emphasis>'sale'</emphasis>.  Each XML message will be grouped by the batch and the column names identified by
        the groupByColumnNames property which have the same values.

          The publisher property on the XmlPublisherDatabaseWriterFilter takes an interface of type IPublisher.  The implementation
          demonstrated here is an implementation that publishes to JMS using Spring's
          <ulink url="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/jms.html#jms-jmstemplate">JMS template</ulink>.
          Other implementations of IPublisher could easily publish the XML to other targets like an HTTP server, the file system or secure copy it to another server.
        </para>
        <para>
          The above configuration will publish XML similar to the following:

            To publish JMS messages during routing
            the same pattern is valid, with the exception that the extension point would be the XmlPublisherDataRouter and the router
            would be configured by setting the <literal>router_type</literal> of a <xref linkend="table_router" xrefstyle="table"/> to the Spring bean
            name of the registered extension point.  Of course, the router would need to be linked through <xref linkend="table_trigger_router" xrefstyle="table"/>s
            to each <xref linkend="table_trigger" xrefstyle="table"/>  table that needs published.

                    web server, like Apache Tomcat.  It's a little more work, but you
                    can configure the web server to do whatever you need.  SymmetricDS can also
                    be embedded in an existing web application, if desired.

                <para>
                    This option means running the <emphasis>sym</emphasis> command line, which launches the built-in Jetty web server.
                    This is a simple option because it is already provided, but you lose the flexibility to configure
                    the web server any further.

                <para>
                    This option means you must write a wrapper Java program that runs
                    SymmetricDS.  You would probably use Jetty web server, which is also embeddable.
                    You could bring up an embedded database like Derby or H2.  You could configure the
                    web server, database, or SymmetricDS to do whatever you needed, but it's also
                    the most work of the three options discussed thus far.

            </listitem>

        <para>
            The deployment model you choose depends on how much flexibility you need versus how easy you
            want it to be.  Both Jetty and Tomcat are excellent, scalable web servers that
            compete with each other and have great performance.  Most people choose either
            the <emphasis>Standalone</emphasis> or <emphasis>Web Archive</emphasis> with Tomcat 5.5 or 6.  Deploying to Tomcat
            is a good middle-of-the-road decision that requires a little more work for more flexibility.

        <title>Clustering</title>
        <para>
        A single SymmetricDS node may be clustered across a series of instances, creating a web farm.  A node might be clustered to provide load balancing and failover, for example.
        </para>
        <para>
        When clustered, a hardware load balancer is typically used
        to round robin client requests to the cluster.  The load balancer should be configured for stateless connections.
        Also, the <literal>sync.url</literal> (discussed in <xref linkend="configuration-node-properties"/>)
        SymmetricDS property should be set to the URL of the load balancer.
        </para>
        <para>
        If the cluster will be running any of the SymmetricDS jobs, then the <literal>cluster.lock.enabled</literal> property should be set to <literal>true</literal>.
        By setting this property to true, SymmetricDS will use a row in the <xref linkend="table_lock" xrefstyle="table"/> table as a semaphore to make sure that only one instance at a time
        runs a job.  When a lock is acquired, a row is updated in the lock table with the time of the lock and the server id of the locking job.  The lock time is set back to null
        when the job is finished running.  Another instance of SymmetricDS cannot aquire a lock until the locking instance (according to the server id) releases the lock.  If an
        instance is terminated while the lock is still held, an instance with the same server id is allowed to reaquire the lock.  If the locking instance remains down, the lock can be
        broken after a period of time, specified by the <literal>cluster.lock.timeout.ms</literal> property, has expired.  Note that if the job is still running and the lock
        expires, two jobs could be running at the same time which could cause database deadlocks.
        </para>
        <para>
        By default, the locking server id is the hostname of the server.  If two clustered instances are running on the same server, then the <literal>cluster.server.id</literal> property
        may be set to indicate the name that the instance should use for its server id.
        </para>
        <para>
        When deploying SymmetricDS to an application server like Tomcat or JBoss, no special session clustering needs to be configured for the application server.

      <section id="encrypted-passwords">
        <title>Encrypted Passwords</title>
        <para>
            The <literal>db.user</literal> and <literal>db.password</literal> properties will accept encrypted text, which protects
            against casual observation.  The text is prefixed with <literal>enc:</literal> to indicate
            that it is encrypted.  To encrypt text, use the following command:

            <programlisting>symadmin -e {engine name} encrypt-text text-to-encrypt</programlisting>
            or
            <programlisting>symadmin -p {properties file} encrypt-text text-to-encrypt</programlisting>

            The text is encrypted using a secret key named "sym.secret" that is retrieved from a keystore file.
            By default, the keystore is located in <filename class="filename">security/keystore</filename>.
            The location and filename of the keystore can be overridden by setting the "sym.keystore.file" system property.
            If the secret key is not found, the system will generate and install a secret key for use with Triple DES cipher.
        </para>
        <para>
            Generate a new secret key for encryption using the <literal>keytool</literal>
            command that comes with the JRE.  If there is an existing key in the keystore, first remove it:

            <programlisting>keytool -keystore keystore -storepass changeit -storetype jceks \
   -alias sym.secret -delete</programlisting>

            Then generate a secret key, specifying a cipher algorithm and key size.
            Commonly used algorithms that are supported include aes, blowfish, desede, and rc4.

            <programlisting>keytool -keystore keystore -storepass changeit -storetype jceks \
   -alias sym.secret -genseckey -keyalg aes -keysize 128</programlisting>

            If using an alternative provider, place the provider JAR file in the SymmetricDS <filename class="directory">lib</filename> folder.
            The provider class name should be installed in the JRE security properties or specified on the command line.
            To install in the JRE, edit the JRE <filename class="filename">lib/security/java.security</filename> file
            and set a <literal>security.provider.i</literal> property for the provider class name.
            Or, the provider can be specified on the command line instead.
            Both <literal>keytool</literal> and <literal>sym</literal> accept command line arguments for the provider class name.
            For example, using the Bouncy Castle provider, the command line options would look like:

            <programlisting>keytool -keystore keystore -storepass changeit -storetype jceks \
   -alias sym.secret -genseckey -keyalg idea -keysize 56 \
   -providerClass org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider \
   -providerPath ..\lib\bcprov-ext.jar</programlisting>
            <programlisting>symadmin -providerClass org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider -e secret</programlisting>

            To customize the encryption, write a Java class that implements the ISecurityService or extends the default SecurityService, and place
            the class on the classpath in either <filename class="directory">lib</filename> or
            <filename class="directory">web/WEB-INF/lib</filename> folders.
            Then, in the <filename class="filename">symmetric.properties</filename> specify your class name for the security service.

            <programlisting>security.service.class.name=org.jumpmind.security.SecurityService</programlisting>

            Remember to specify your properties file when encrypting passwords, so it will use your custom ISecurityService.

            For incoming HTTPS connections, SymmetricDS depends on the webserver where
            it is deployed, so the webserver must be configured for HTTPS.
            As a standalone deployment, the "sym" launcher command provides options for
            enabling HTTPS support.

                <filename class="filename">JRE_HOME/lib/security/cacerts</filename>.
                The "sym" launcher command overrides the trusted keystore to use its own
                trusted keystore instead, which is located at
                <filename class="filename">security/cacerts</filename>.
                This keystore contains the certificate aliased as "sym" for use in testing
                and easing deployments.
                The trusted keystore can be overridden

          By default, the web management console can be opened from the following address:

          <programlisting><![CDATA[http://localhost:31416/]]></programlisting>

          In order to use jconsole, you must enable JMX remote management in the JVM. You can edit the startup scripts to set the following system
          parameters.

          <programlisting><![CDATA[
          -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=31417
          -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
          -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
          ]]></programlisting>

          </para>
          <para>
          Using the Java jconsole command, SymmetricDS is listed as a local process named SymmetricLauncher.
          In jconsole, SymmetricDS appears under the MBeans tab under the name defined by the <literal>engine.name</literal>
          property.  The default value is SymmetricDS.
