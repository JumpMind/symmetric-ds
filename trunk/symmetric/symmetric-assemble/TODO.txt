TODO = *
DONE = +

* Go through every class and fix javadoc, remove unused methods, follow conventions, and fix generics/warnings

* Setup build for 
  + 2.x 
  * 3.x

* Port CsvLoader and DataLoaderTest over.  Check-in and make sure all unit tests work.
  + Clean up statistics.  Take a pass through each of the reader/writers and make sure stats are recorded
  + Delete IDataLoaderFilter, IBatchListener
  + Introduce handler for conflict resolution.  Implement default handler to start with
  + Setting for whether to update all columns or only the columns that changed
  + Plug in transform database writer  
  * Add settings to channel
  * Lookup/choose datawriter based on channel settings
  * clean up error handling in loader service
  * SqlScript for Informix
  * Implement a jdbc batch loader
    
* Use data processor for extract
  + Add dependency on spring-jdbc from symmetric-db (lob handlers and statement creators)
  + lob handling for extract
  + Finish DataExtractorService data selector
  + map target tables from routers
  + integrate into data extractor service
  + add transform writer
  + add staging file management api
  * verify stats capturing, outgoing batch updates  
  * unit test
  * purge job for staging manager
  * make sure memory buffer is cleared when state goes to done

* Hook up JMX

+ Use data processor for streaming to file  
+ Clean up logging  
  + Use SLF4J and MDC (for capturing the engine & node name)
+ What to do with SqlTemplate? Move sqltemplate into dbdialect
+ Clean up symmetric.messages
  
* Use HttpClient?
* Add table copy utility
* Clean up service tests    
* Purge OK records instead of purging them at a later date
* Test batch inserts for router service
* Remove all references to data_ref
* Change the default server mode to multiserver
* SqlMap create constants for columns and table names
* SqlMap, TriggerTemplate format better

* Test timezone columns.  Do other databases other than oracle and postgres have timezone columns?

Performance Improvement Opportunities
* Pluggable data loaders.
* Sync based on updated column values (timestamp or flag)
* Transaction Log Parsing (vs. triggers)  
* Optimize triggers (don't capture old data.  option to capture only primary keys)
* Routing optimizations - allow a channel to always sync to everybody.  Update sym_outgoing_batch to have a PK of batch_id, node_id.
* Web Sockets protocol
* HttpClient (pool connections)

Documentation
* Change getting started to instruct user to update properties in the engines directory (for multiserver mode)
* Update documentation for extension points

3.0 Change Notes:
* The db.metadata.ignore.case property is no long available.  All configured database names will be case sensitive
* db.spring.bean.name is no longer available
* dataloader will now load each batch as it arrives.
* datareload.batch.insert.transactional is no longer available
* routing.data.reader.type is no longer available.  data_ref has been removed.
* jdbc datasources are no longer supported
* All data loader properties will be configurable by channel
* IDatabaseWriterFilter replaces IDataLoaderFilter
* IDatabaseWriterFilter replaces IBatchListener
* db.default.schema is no longer used
* No longer stop purge from running if there wasn't an initial load
* Extensions no longer have services injected into them.  If they need acccess to services, they should implement ISymmetricEngineAware
* Node concurrency manager no longer allows the same node to make a second request while it already has a reservation
* Added stage management job (that purges staged files)
