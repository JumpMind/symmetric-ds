    <title>Quick Start</title>
    <para>Now that an overview of SymmetricDS has been discussed, a quick working example of SymmetricDS is in order. 
        This section contains a hands-on tutorial that demonstrates how to synchronize a sample database between a client
        and server engine deployed in a single instance of SymmetricDS. This example models a retail business that has a 
        central office database (called "server") and multiple retail store databases (called "client").  
        For the tutorial, we will have only one "client", as shown in <xref linkend="figure-tutorial" xrefstyle="select: label"/>.

        The server engine captures item data changes for the client, such as
        item number, description, and price. The client engine captures sale transaction data 
        changes for the server, such as time of sale and items sold. 
        The sample configuration has the client always initiating communication with the server.  The client
        will attach to the server on a periodic basis to pull data from the server.  The client will
        also push captured changes for the server to the server when changes are available.</para>

                    process where the node receives its configuration and stores it in its database. The configuration describes
                    which database tables to synchronize and to which nodes. When an unregistered node starts up, it will
                    register with the node specified by the registration URL. The registration node centrally controls nodes on
                    the network by allowing registration and returning configuration. In this tutorial, the registration node is
                    the server node, which also participates in synchronization with other nodes.</para>

        <para> Next, we need to open registration for the client node so that it may receive its initial load of

        <title>Verifying Outgoing Batches</title>
        <para>Now that we have pushed and pulled data, we will demonstrate how you can obtain information about what data has been batched and sent.
         A batch is used for tracking and sending data changes to nodes. The sending node creates a batch and the receiving
            node acknowledges it. A batch in error is retried during synchronization attempts, but only after data changes in
            other channels are allowed to be sent. Channels are categories assigned to tables for the purpose of independent
            synchronization and control. Batches for a channel are not created when a batch in the channel is in error status.

            <step>
                <para> Verify that the data change you made was captured:</para>
                <para>
                    <command> select * from sym_data order by data_id desc;</command>
                </para>
                <para> Each row represents a row of data that was changed. The event_type is "I" for insert, "U" for update", or
                    "D" for delete. For insert and update, the captured data values are listed in row_data. For update and delete,
                    the primary key values are listed in pk_data.</para>
            </step>
            <step>
                <para> Verify that the data change was routed to a node, using the data_id from the previous step:</para>
                <para>
                    <command> select * from sym_data_event where data_id = ?;</command>
                </para>
                <para> When the batched flag is set, the data change is assigned to a batch using a batch_id that is used to track
                    and synchronize the data. Batches are created and assigned during a push or pull synchronization.</para>
            </step>
            <step>
                <para> Verify that the data change was batched, sent, and acknowledged, using the batch_id from the previous step:

                <para>
                    <command> select * from sym_outgoing_batch where batch_id = ?;</command>
                </para>
                <para> A batch represents a collection of changes to be sent to a node. The batch is created during a push or pull
                    synchronization, when the status is set to "NE" for new. The receiving node acknowledges the batch with a
                    status of "OK" for success or "ER" for error.</para>
            </step>

        Understanding these three tables, along with a fourth table discussed in the next section, is key to diagnosing any synchronizaiton issues you might encounter.
        As you work with SymmetricDS, either when experimenting or starting to use SymmetricDS on your own data, spend time monitoring these tables to
        better understand how SymmetricDS works.

        <para> The receiving node keeps track of the batches it acknowledges and records statistics about loading the data.
            Duplicate batches are skipped by default, but this behavior can be changed with the <literal>incoming.batches.skip.duplicates</literal>
            runtime property.</para>
