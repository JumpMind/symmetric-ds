        <para>
            SymmetricDS allows tables to be synchronized bi-directionally.  Note that an outgoing 
            synchronization does not process changes during an incoming synchronization on the same node unless the trigger 
            was created with the <literal>sync_on_incoming_batch</literal> flag set.  If the <literal>sync_on_incoming_batch</literal> flag
            is set, then update loops are prevented by a feature that is available in most database dialects.  
            More specifically, during an incoming synchronization the source <literal>node_id</literal> is put into a database session variable that is 
            available to the database trigger.  Data events are not generated if the target <literal>node_id</literal> 
            on an outgoing synchronization is equal to the source <literal>node_id</literal>.  
        </para>     
        <para>
            By default, only the columns that changed will be updated in the target system.

            More complex conflict resolution strategies can be accomplished by using the

        <para>
            As shown in <xref linkend="organizing-nodes"/>, there may be
            scenarios where data needs to flow through multiple tiers of nodes that
            are organized in a tree-like network with each tier requiring a different subset of data.  For example,
            you may have a system where the lowest tier may by a computer or device located in a store.  Those devices 
            may connect to a server located physically at that store.  Then the store server may communicate with 
            a corporate server for example.  In this case, the three tiers would be device, store, and corporate.
            Each tier is typically represented by a node group.  Each node in 
            the tier would belong to the node group representing that tier.   
        </para>
        <para>
            A node will always push and pull data to other node groups according to the node group link configuration.
            A node can only pull and push data to other nodes that are represented <literal>node</literal> table in its database and 
            having <literal>sync_enabled = 1</literal>.
            Because of this, a tree-like 
            hierarchy of nodes can be created by having only a subset of nodes belonging to the same node group represented at the different branches of the tree.  
        </para>
        <para>
            If auto registration is turned <emphasis>off</emphasis>, then this setup must occur manually by opening registration 
            for the desired nodes at the desired parent node and by configuring each node's <literal>registration.url</literal>
             to be the parent node's URL.  
            The parent node is always tracked by the setting of the parent's <literal>node_id</literal> in the <literal>created_at_node_id</literal> column of the new node.  
            When a node registers and downloads its configuration it is always provided the configuration for nodes 
            that might register with the node itself based on the Node Group Links defined in the parent node.

        <title>Registration Redirect</title>    
        <para>
            When deploying a multi-tiered system it may be advantageous to have only one registration server, even though the parent node of a registering node
            could be any of a number of nodes in the system.  In SymmetricDS the parent node is always the node that a child registers with.  The 
            <xref linkend="table_registration_redirect" xrefstyle="table"/> table allows a single node, usually the root server in the network, to
            redirect registering nodes to their true parents.  It does so based on a mapping found in the table of the external id (<literal>registrant_external_id</literal>) to the parent's node 
            id (<literal>registration_node_id</literal>).
        </para>
        <para>
            For example, if it is desired to have a series of regional servers that workstations at retail stores get assigned to based on their <literal>external_id</literal>, the store number, then
            you might insert into <xref linkend="table_registration_redirect" xrefstyle="table"/> the store number as the <literal>registrant_external_id</literal> and the <literal>node_id</literal> of
            the assigned region as the <literal>registration_node_id</literal>.  When a workstation at the store registers, the root server send an HTTP redirect to the <literal>sync_url</literal> of the node 
            that matches the <literal>registration_node_id</literal>.

        The SymmetricDS software allows for outgoing and incoming changes to be synchronized
        to/from other databases.  The node that initiates a synchronization connection is the client, and the
        node receiving a connection is the host.  Because synchronization is configurable to
        push or pull in either direction, the same node can act as either a client or a host
        in different circumstances.
    </para>
    <para>
        The SymmetricDS software consists of a series of background jobs, managers, Servlets, and services wired together
        via dependency injection using the <ulink url="http://springframework.org">Spring Framework</ulink>.
    </para>    
     
    <para>
        As a client, the node runs the router job, push job and pull job on a timer thread.  
        The router job uses services to create batches that are targeted at certain nodes.  
        The push job uses services to extract and stream data to
        another node (that is, it pushes data).  The response from a push is a list
        of batch acknowlegements to indicate that data was loaded.
        The pull job uses services to load data that is streamed from another node
        (<emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, it pulls data).  After loading data, a second connection is made to send a list
        of batch acknowlegements.
    </para>
    <para>
        As a host, the node waits for incoming connections that pull, push, or acknowledge data changes.
        The push Servlet uses services to load data that is pushed from a client node.
        After loading data, it responds with a list of batch acknowledgements.
        The pull Servlet uses services to extract, and stream data back to the client node.
        The ack Servlet uses services to update the status of data that was loaded at a client node.  The router
        job batches and routes data.
    </para>
    <para>
        By default, data is extracted from the source database into memory until a threshold size is reached.
        If the threshold size is reached, data is streamed to a temporary file in the JVM's default temporary 
        directory.  Next, the data is streamed to the target node across the transport layer.  The receiving
        node will cache the data in memory until the threshold size is reached, writing to a temporary file if
        necessary.  At last, the data is loaded into the target database by the data loader.  This step by step
        approach allows for extract time, transport time, and load time to all be measured independently.  It 
        also allows database resources to be used most optimally.
    </para>    
    <para>
        The transport manager handles the incoming and outgoing streams of data between nodes.
        The default transport is based on a simple implementation over HTTP.  An internal transport
        is also provided.  It is possible to add other implementations, such as a socket-based transport manager.

        <section id="routing-job-overview">
        <title>Overview</title>
      <para>
        The SymmetricDS-created database triggers cause data to be capture in the <xref linkend="table_data" xrefstyle="table"/> table.
        The next step in the synchronization process is to process the change data to determine which nodes, if any, the data should
        be routed to.  This step is performed by the <emphasis>Route Job</emphasis>.  In addition to determining which nodes data will
        be sent to, the Route Job is also responsible for determing how much data will be batched together for transport. 
        It is a single background task that inserts into <xref linkend="table_data_event" xrefstyle="table"/> 
        and <xref linkend="table_outgoing_batch" xrefstyle="table"/>.  
     </para>
     <para>
         At a high level, the Route Job is straightforward.  It collects a list of data ids from <xref linkend="table_data" xrefstyle="table"/> 
         which haven't yet been routed (see <xref linkend="data-gaps" /> for much more detail about this step), 
         one channel at a time, up to a limit specified by the channel configuration
         (<literal>max_data_to_route</literal>, on  <xref linkend="table_channel" xrefstyle="table"/>).
         The data is then batched based on the <literal>batch_algorithm</literal> defined for the channel and as documented in 
          <xref linkend="configuration-channel"/>.  Note that, for the default batching algorithm, there may actually be more than <literal>max_data_to_route</literal> included depending
         on the transaction boundaries.  The mapping of data to specific nodes, organized into batches, is then 
         recorded in    <xref linkend="table_outgoing_batch" xrefstyle="table"/> with a status of "RT" in each case (representing the
         fact that the Route Job is still running).
         Once the routing algorithms and batching are completed, the batches are organized with their corresponding data ids 
         and saved in <xref linkend="table_data_event" xrefstyle="table"/>.  Once <xref linkend="table_data_event" xrefstyle="table"/> is
         updated, the rows in <xref linkend="table_outgoing_batch" xrefstyle="table"/> are updated to a status of New "NE".
    </para>
    </section>
    <section id="data-gaps">
        <title>Data Gaps</title>
      <para>
      On the surface, the first Route Job step of collecting unrouted data ids seems simple: assign
     sequential data ids for each data row as it's inserted and keep track of which data id was last routed and start from there.  The difficulty arises, however, due to the fact that 
     there can be multiple transactions inserting into <xref linkend="table_data" xrefstyle="table"/> simultaneously.
     As such, a given section of rows in the  <xref linkend="table_data" xrefstyle="table"/> table may actually contain "gaps" in the data ids when the Route Job is executing.
     Most of these gaps are only temporarily and fill in at some point after routing and need to be picked up with the next run of the Route Job.  Thus, the Route Job needs to
     remember to route the filled-in gaps.  Worse yet, some of these gaps are actually permanent and result from
     a transaction that is rolled back for some reason.  In this case, the Route Job must continue to watch
     for the gap to fill in and, at some point, eventually gives up and assumes the gap is permanent and can be skipped.  All of this
     must be done in some fashion that guarantees that gaps are routed when they fill in while also keeping
     routing as efficient as possible.
     </para>
     <para>
     SymmetricDS handles the issue of data gaps by making use of a table, <xref linkend="table_data_gap" xrefstyle="table"/>, to record
     gaps found in the data ids.  In fact, this table completely defines the entire range of data tha can be routed at any point in time.
     For a brand new instance of SymmetricDS, this table is empty
     and SymmetricDS creates a gap starting from data id of zero and ending with a very large number (defined by <literal>routing.largest.gap.size</literal>).
     At the start of a Route Job, the list of valid gaps (gaps with status of 'GP') is collected, and each gap is evaluated in turn.
     If a gap is sufficiently old (as defined by <literal>routing.stale.dataid.gap.time.ms</literal>, the gap
     is marked as skipped (status of 'SK') and will no longer be evaluated in future Route Jobs (note that the 'last' gap (the one with the highest starting data id) is never
     skipped).  If not skipped, then  <xref linkend="table_data_event" xrefstyle="table"/> is searched for data ids present in the gap.
     If one or more data ids is found in <xref linkend="table_data_event" xrefstyle="table"/>, then the current gap is marked with a status
     of OK, and new gap(s) are created to represent the data ids still missing in the gap's range.  This process is done for
     all gaps.  If the very last gap contained data, a new gap starting from the highest data id and ending at (highest data id + <literal>routing.largest.gap.size</literal>) is then created.
     This process has resulted in an updated list of gaps which may contain new data to be routed.

        <title>Controlling Synchronization Frequency</title>
        <para>
        The frequency of data synchronization is controlled by the coordination of a series of asynchronous events.   
        </para>    
        <para>
        The Route Job determines which nodes
        data will be sent to, as well as how much data will be batched together for transport.  When the <literal>start.route.job</literal> SymmetricDS property is set to 
        <literal>true</literal>, the frequency that routing occurs is controlled by the <literal>job.routing.period.time.ms</literal>.  Each time data is routed, the 
        <xref linkend="table_data_ref" xrefstyle="table"/> table is updated with the id of the last contiguous data row to have been processed.  This is done so the query to find
        unrouted data is optimal. 
        </para>
        <para>
        After data is routed, it awaits transport to the target nodes.  Transport can occur when a client node is configured to pull data or when the host node is configured to push data.  These
        events are controlled by the <emphasis>Push</emphasis> and the <emphasis>Pull Jobs</emphasis>.  When the <literal>start.pull.job</literal> SymmetricDS property is set to 
        <literal>true</literal>, the frequency that data is pulled is controlled by the <literal>job.pull.period.time.ms</literal>.  When the <literal>start.push.job</literal> SymmetricDS property is set to 
        <literal>true</literal>, the frequency that data is pushed is controlled by the <literal>job.push.period.time.ms</literal>.  Data is extracted by channel from the source database's 
        <xref linkend="table_data" xrefstyle="table"/> table at an interval controlled by the <literal>extract_period_millis</literal> column on the 
        <xref linkend="table_channel" xrefstyle="table"/> table.  The <literal>last_extract_time</literal> is 
        always recorded, by channel, on the <xref linkend="table_node_channel_ctl" xrefstyle="table"/> table for the host node's id.  When the Pull and Push Job run, if the extract period
        has not passed according to the last extract time, then the channel will be skipped for this run.  If the <literal>extract_period_millis</literal> is set to zero, data extraction will happen every time the jobs run.
        </para>
        <para>
        SymmetricDS also provides the ability to configure windows of time when synchronization is allowed.  This is done using the
        <xref linkend="table_node_group_channel_window" xrefstyle="table"/> 
        table.  A list of allowed time windows can be specified for a node group and a channel.  If one or more windows exist, then data will only be extracted and transported if the time
        of day falls within the window of time specified.  The configured times are always for the target node's local time.  If the <literal>start_time</literal> is greater than the <literal>end_time</literal>, then the window crosses
        over to the next day.
        </para>
        <para>
        All data loading may be disabled by setting the <literal>dataloader.enable</literal> property to false.  This has the effect of not allowing incoming synchronizations, while allowing outgoing
        synchronizations.  All data extractions may be disabled by setting the <literal>dataextractor.enable</literal> property to false.  These properties can be controlled by inserting into the 
        root server's <xref linkend="table_parameter" xrefstyle="table"/> table.  These properties affect every channel with the exception of the 'config' channel.

    <section id="sync-triggers">
        <title>Sync Triggers Job</title>
        <para>
            SymmetricDS examines the current configuration, corresponding database triggers,
            and the underlying tables to determine if database triggers need created or updated.
            The change activity is recorded on the <xref linkend="table_trigger_hist" xrefstyle="table"/> table with a reason for the
            change.  The following reasons for a change are possible:

            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>N - New trigger that has not been created before</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>S - Schema changes in the table were detected</para>
                </listitem>

                    <para>C - Configuration changes in Trigger</para>

                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            A configuration entry in Trigger without any history in Trigger Hist results in a new
            trigger being created (N).  The Trigger Hist stores a hash of the underlying table, so
            any alteration to the table causes the trigger to be rebuilt (S).  When the 
            <literal>last_update_time</literal> is changed on the Trigger entry, the configuration change causes

            The process of examining triggers and rebuilding them is automatically run during startup and
            each night by the SyncTriggersJob.  The user can also manually run the process at any time 
            by invoking the <literal>syncTriggers()</literal> method over JMX.  The SyncTriggersJob is enabled by default 
            to run at 15 minutes past midnight.  If SymmetricDS is being run from a collection of servers
            (multiple instances of the same Node running against the same database), then locking
            should be enable to prevent database contention.  The following runtime properties
            control the behavior of the process.

        <para>
            With the proper configuration SymmetricDS can publish XML messages of captured data changes to 
            JMS during routing or transactionally while data loading synchronized data into a target database.
            The following explains how to publish to JMS during synchronization to the target database. 
       </para>
       <para>     
            The XmlPublisherDataLoaderFilter is a
            <xref linkend="extensions-data-loader-filter" xrefstyle="table"/> that may be configured to 
            publish specific tables as an XML message to a JMS provider.
            See <xref linkend="extensions"/> for information on how 
            to configure an extension point.  If the publish to JMS fails, the batch will be marked in error, 
            the loaded data for the batch will be rolled back
            and the batch will be retried during the next synchronization run.            
        </para>
        <para>
        The following is an example extension point configuration that will publish four tables in XML with a root 
        tag of <emphasis>'sale'</emphasis>.  Each XML message will be grouped by the batch and the column names identified by
        the groupByColumnNames property which have the same values.

          The publisher property on the XmlPublisherDataLoaderFilter takes an interface of type IPublisher.  The implementation
          demonstrated here is an implementation that publishes to JMS using Spring's 
          <ulink url="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/jms.html#jms-jmstemplate">JMS template</ulink>.
          Other implementations of IPublisher could easily publish the XML to other targets like an HTTP server, the file system or secure copy it to another server.
        </para>
        <para>
          The above configuration will publish XML similiar to the following:

            To publish JMS messages during routing
            the same pattern is valid, with the exception that the extension point would be the XmlPublisherDataRouter and the router 
            would be configured by setting the <literal>router_type</literal> of a <xref linkend="table_router" xrefstyle="table"/> to the Spring bean
            name of the registered extension point.  Of course, the router would need to be linked through <xref linkend="table_trigger_router" xrefstyle="table"/>s
            to each <xref linkend="table_trigger" xrefstyle="table"/>  table that needs published.

                    web server, like Apache Tomcat.  It's a little more work, but you
                    can configure the web server to do whatever you need.  SymmetricDS can also 
                    be embedded in an existing web application, if desired.

                    This is a simple option because it is already provided, but you lose the flexibility to configure

                    This option means you must write a wrapper Java program that runs
                    SymmetricDS.  You would probably use Jetty web server, which is also embeddable.
                    You could bring up an embedded database like Derby or H2.  You could configure the
                    web server, database, or SymmetricDS to do whatever you needed, but it's also
                    the most work of the three options discussed thus far.

            The deployment model you choose depends on how much flexibility you need versus how easy you
            want it to be.  Both Jetty and Tomcat are excellent, scalable web servers that
            compete with each other and have great performance.  Most people choose either
            the <emphasis>Standalone</emphasis> or <emphasis>Web Archive</emphasis> with Tomcat 5.5 or 6.  Deploying to Tomcat
            is a good middle-of-the-road decision that requires a little more work for more flexibility.

        <title>Clustering</title>
        <para>
        A single SymmetricDS node may be clustered across a series of instances, creating a web farm.  A node might be clustered to provide load balancing and failover, for example.
        </para>
        <para>
        When clustered, a hardware load balancer is typically used
        to round robin client requests to the cluster.  The load balancer should be configured for stateless connections.  
        Also, the <literal>sync.url</literal> (discussed in <xref linkend="configuration-node-properties"/>)
        SymmetricDS property should be set to the URL of the load balancer.  
        </para>
        <para>
        If the cluster will be running any of the SymmetricDS jobs, then the <literal>cluster.lock.enabled</literal> property should be set to <literal>true</literal>. 
        By setting this property to true, SymmetricDS will use a row in the <xref linkend="table_lock" xrefstyle="table"/> table as a semaphore to make sure that only one instance at a time
        runs a job.  When a lock is acquired, a row is updated in the lock table with the time of the lock and the server id of the locking job.  The lock time is set back to null
        when the job is finished running.  Another instance of SymmetricDS cannot aquire a lock until the locking instance (according to the server id) releases the lock.  If an 
        instance is terminated while the lock is still held, an instance with the same server id is allowed to reaquire the lock.  If the locking instance remains down, the lock can be 
        broken after a period of time, specified by the <literal>cluster.lock.timeout.ms</literal> property, has expired.  Note that if the job is still running and the lock
        expires, two jobs could be running at the same time which could cause database deadlocks. 
        </para>
        <para>
        By default, the locking server id is the hostname of the server.  If two clustered instances are running on the same server, then the <literal>cluster.server.id</literal> property 
        may be set to indicate the name that the instance should use for its server id.
        </para>
        <para>
        When deploying SymmetricDS to an application server like Tomcat or JBoss, no special session clustering needs to be configured for the application server.

            that it is encrypted.  To encrypt text, use the following command:

            The text is encrypted by the cipher defined as alias "sym.secret" in the 
            Java keystore.  The keystore is specified by the "sym.keystore.file" system property, which
            defaults to <filename class="filename">security/keystore</filename>.
            If a cipher is not found, a default cipher using Triple DES with a random password
            is generated.

                When SymmetricDS connects to a URL with HTTPS, Java checks the validity of the

                <filename class="filename">JRE_HOME/lib/security/cacerts</filename>.
                The "sym" launcher command overrides the trusted keystore to use its own
                trusted keystore instead, which is located at
                <filename class="filename">security/cacerts</filename>.
                This keystore contains the certificate aliased as "sym" for use in testing
                and easing deployments.                
                The trusted keystore can be overridden
