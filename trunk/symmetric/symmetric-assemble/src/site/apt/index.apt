Overview

 SymmetricDS is an asynchronous data replication software package that supports multiple subscribers and bi-directional
 synchronization. It uses web and database technologies to replicate tables between relational
 databases, in near real time if desired. The software was designed to scale for a large number of databases, work across
 low-bandwidth connections, and withstand periods of network outage.  

 By using database triggers, SymmetricDS guarantees that data changes are captured and atomicity is preserved.
 Support for database vendors is provided through a Database Dialect layer,
 with implementations for MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, DB2, Firebird, HSQLDB, H2, and Apache Derby included.

 Synchronization can be configured to push data or pull data on a periodic basis.
 SymmetricDS allows for synchronization between two or more tiers of nodes, as might be needed in the following scenarios:

    * A farm of web server nodes fronting an enterprise-class general office database
    
    * A handful of regional servers for synchronizing from the general office to remote geographical areas
     
    * 10(s) of Point of Sale (POS) register nodes using an embedded database to sync with a store server
    
    * 1000(s) of store server nodes using a departmental class database to sync with a regional node
    
 
 Deployment options include the following:
 
    * Web application archive (WAR) deployed to an application server such as Tomcat, Jetty, or JBoss
    
    * Standalone service
    
    * Embedded in an application
 
 SymmetricDS is written in Java and licensed as open source software under the

Background
 
 The idea of SymmetricDS was born from a real-world need. Several of the original developers were, several years
 ago, implementing a commercial Point of Sale (POS) system for a large retailer. The development team came to the
 conclusion that the software available for trickling back transactions to corporate headquarters 
 (frequently known as the 'central office' or 'general office') did not meet the project needs. The developers started 
 an open-source project, now known as SymmetricDS, to build a generalized, flexible software product that would meet
 the needs for the project and for others with similar needs.
