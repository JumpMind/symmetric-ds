/**
 * Identifies one batch pull that was interrupted partway through and is still eligible for a resumed retry. The {@code etag} is captured as soon as it is read
 * from the batch's proactive {@code ETAG} preamble line, since the connection can drop before the server gets a chance to send it again. {@code channelId} and
 * {@code binaryEncoding} are captured from the same preamble so a resumed ({@code 206}) response - which contains only the remaining row data - can reconstruct
 * the batch's identity locally.
 * <p>
 * {@code queue} lets {@link IHttpResumeCache#getPendingForNode(String, String)} restrict a lookup to the one queue that owns this batch, but it's not a
 * sufficient discriminator on its own: table-sync and file-sync channels commonly share a queue. {@code fileSync} is the unambiguous marker, set directly by
 * the registering code, that each resume consumer uses to recognize only the entries it registered itself.
